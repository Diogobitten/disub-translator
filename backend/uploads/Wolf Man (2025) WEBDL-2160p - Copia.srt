1
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,758
Ten-hut!

2
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,784
Grab your hunting pack.
We're leaving at 0700.

3
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,233
This view never gets old,
does it?

4
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,204
No matter how many times
you see it.

5
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,760
Ah, don't go anywhere
near those.

6
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,929
These are death cap mushrooms.
The name ain't kidding.

7
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,401
Eat one of those, you'll be
wearing a toe tag real quick

8
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,432
unless someone's got
a brand-new liver

9
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,307
lying around for you.
