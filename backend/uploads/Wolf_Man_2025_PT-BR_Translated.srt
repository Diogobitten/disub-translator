1
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,758
Sentido!

2
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,784
Pegue seu kit de caça. Vamos sair às 07h00.

3
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,233
Essa vista nunca envelhece, não é?

4
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,204
Não importa quantas vezes você veja.

5
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,760
Ah, não chegue perto daquilo.

6
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,929
São cogumelos venenosos. O nome não é à toa.

7
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,401
Se comer um desses, você vai acabar no necrotério rapidinho

8
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,432
a menos que alguém tenha um fígado novinho

9
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,307
dando sopa pra você.

10
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,177
Blake. Blake.

11
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:11,312
Blake.

12
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:13,212
Você ouviu o que eu disse?

13
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,279
Sim, senhor.

14
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:15,644
O que eu disse?

15
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,119
Não coma os cogumelos.

16
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:18,554
Como eles se chamam?

17
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,384
Uh...

18
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,427
See, this is what I'm talking about-- you're not hearing me.

19
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,562
Você está perdido no seu próprio mundo.

20
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,763
Este lugar é lindo. Mas também é perigoso.

21
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:32,429
Você pode sobreviver se souber exatamente o que fazer.

22
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,800
Sim, senhor.

23
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:39,872
People get taken from you-- -- like that.

24
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,578
Não é difícil morrer.

25
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,915
É a coisa mais fácil do mundo.

26
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,919
We are all...

27
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,423
inches away from it.

28
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,788
And I'm not always gonna be around to watch over you,

29
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,152
but I'm gonna make damn sure that you know

30
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,463
how to survive as...

31
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,333
Blake.

32
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,300
Blake.

33
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,816
You know you need to stay near me.

34
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:08,119
Right fucking next to me, boy!

35
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:10,161
If you don't do what I say, you get hurt.

36
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,261
Do you want to get hurt?! Huh?

37
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,264
Do you want to get hurt?!

38
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,798
No, sir, I don't. I just...

39
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,229
I wanted to get a better shot at the deer.

40
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,593
Get up in that deer blind.

41
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,165
Now.

42
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,102
Cover your ears.

43
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,139
What was it, Dad?

44
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:51,648
A bear.

45
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,850
They're all over this side of the valley.

46
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:56,819
Pick yourself up, and let's go

47
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,954
while there's still some light left.

48
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,167
Kiel 714, this is Lovell 819.

49
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,370
Kiel 714, this is Lovell 819.

50
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,003
Kiel 714, this is Lovell 819. Do you read me?

51
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,711
Where in the hell are you, Dan?

52
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,912
DAN What is it, Grady?

53
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,953
Dan.

54
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,918
I saw it.

55
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,385
Saw what?

56
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,725
You know what I'm talking about.

57
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,061
That hiker?

58
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,697
The face of the wolf?

59
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,069
Dan, it's real.

60
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,242
I had it in my scope.

61
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,002
I almost shot it.

62
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,208
Grady, what is the point

63
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:57,949
in going up that mountain after dark

64
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,752
looking for something that doesn't want to be found?

65
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,150
I wasn't looking for it.

66
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,522
I was hunting deer down by the river.

67
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,184
And it came after my boy.

68
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,554
I'm gonna get it, Dan.

69
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,963
And you got to come with me.

70
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:16,828
Don't you want to keep your boy safe?

71
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,003
Can we get some ice cream?

72
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,266
Please? Please, please, please, please, please, please...

73
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,297
I got you a hot chocolate at the museum.

74
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:57,934
That's not a dessert.

75
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,510
That's a drink.

76
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,308
Oh, I think it's dessert, missy.

77
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:08,247
Well, did you know you're the best dad in the whole world?

78
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,150
Yeah, I'm sure the timing of that

79
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:12,086
has nothing to do with the ice cream.

80
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:14,049
It doesn't. I just wanted to tell you.

81
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,693
I'm serious.

82
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,792
Eh, this feels very transactional.

83
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,391
I don't know what that means.

84
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,299
Hey, get down.

85
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,864
Ginger.

86
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,066
Get down right now.

87
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,670
Okay, that's it, no ice cream

88
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,372
in three, two, one.

89
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,305
No, the dog don't jump off the motherfucking leash!

90
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,310
Hey, hey, hey.

91
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,818
I told you to get down.

92
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,115
Why didn't you listen to me, damn it?

93
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,055
Why didn't you listen to me?

94
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,194
I'm sorry.

95
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:58,863
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

96
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,197
That's not me.

97
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,897
I don't want to be like that.

98
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,908
I just need you to listen when I tell you something.

99
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:07,941
'Cause what's my job?

100
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,205
To keep your daughter safe.

101
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,547
Yeah. That's right.

102
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,275
And what's your job?

103
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:15,810
To read minds.

104
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,749
Can you guess what I'm thinking right now?

105
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,561
"I love my little girl."

106
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:28,656
That's amazing.

107
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,062
That's exactly what I was thinking.

108
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,462
How do you do that every time?

109
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:33,204
You're so good at your job.

110
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,367
Okay.

111
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,631
I'm sorry. You scared me, okay?

112
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,201
- You owe me a dollar. - Why?

113
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,603
Because you sweared.

114
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,041
No, I didn't. You're hearing things.

115
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,748
I'm not, Daddy. You sweared.

116
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,555
Okay, now let me put some on you.

117
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,649
Oh, my God. Okay, do it quickly.

118
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,022
- Beautiful. - Mm-hmm. Good?

119
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:58,589
- Yeah. - How's this?

120
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,427
You look creepy.

121
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:03,565
You mean like this?

122
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,265
- You mean like this, Ginger? - Dad.

123
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,203
No, uh, yeah. No, I get that.

124
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,240
Okay, go sit at the table.

125
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,441
No, but I-I have, I have a second source.

126
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:20,541
One minute.

127
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,151
Well, are you gonna ship it

128
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,348
or you gonna let the <i>Times</i> scoop us again?

129
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,088
-  Hi. - Hi, Mommy.

130
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:29,884
Well, so we have a deal then?

131
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,028
What-- This is bullshit.

132
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,395
You've never asked for this before.

133
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:37,967
Uh, in the time it takes to do all of this,

134
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,235
we could've gotten ahead of everybody.

135
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,105
But I just don't think we need to do it.

136
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,142
I promise from now on. Can you just get it online?

137
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,310
- Take that in the other room. - Shh.

138
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:50,844
I shouldn't be doing this.

139
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,611
Are you doing it or not?

140
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:55,147
Charlotte, can you take that in the other room?

141
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:56,912
Listen, I-I know what I'm doing.

142
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:00,156
You know I know because you taught me how to do it.

143
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,822
Goodbye, Charlotte.

144
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,963
Okay. Bye.

145
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:12,769
Can you, um...

146
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,369
Can you not do that, please?

147
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,132
What did I do?

148
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,172
I was having an important conversation with my editor.

149
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:21,879
Yeah, 'cause you're the only one

150
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,206
that has important stuff going on, right?

151
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm not busy at all.

152
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,775
If I ever have kids, I'm never gonna fight in front of them.

153
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,117
We're not fighting, honey.

154
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,517
We're having a spirited exchange.

155
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,626
Okay.

156
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,822
So, um...

157
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:45,201
I just found out my dad has been finally declared deceased.

158
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:49,271
Officially, by the state of Oregon.

159
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,737
Um, I'm sorry.

160
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:57,312
It's okay.

161
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,317
How do you feel?

162
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,852
I mean, we knew this letter was coming one day.

163
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,453
But the finality of it...

164
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,884
Yeah, I don't know, it's still shocking.

165
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,892
Yeah.

166
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,724
Are you sad, Daddy?

167
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,870
I am, yeah.

168
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm sad about a lot of things.

169
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,535
I wish I'd known him better.

170
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:27,175
But he always made me afraid of him,

171
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,675
so as soon as I was old enough, I left.

172
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,475
We hadn't spoken in a long time

173
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,812
because I chose not to.

174
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:40,124
Um, and now that I can't speak to him...

175
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,590
...I suddenly want to.

176
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,064
The whole day.

177
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,267
No way. The whole thing felt ridiculous, you know?

178
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,239
Oh.

179
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:06,340
I'll catch up with you guys later.

180
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:07,879
Yeah.

181
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,010
Hey.

182
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:12,486
Hey.

183
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,049
This is a surprise.

184
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,591
I brought you some lunch.

185
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,458
Thank you.

186
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:23,599
We haven't done this in a while.

187
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:24,729
Yeah.

188
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:37,940
Are you happy, Charlotte?

189
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,449
Yeah.

190
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:44,188
Yeah.

191
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:46,791
Are-are you?

192
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,687
Why-why are you asking me that?

193
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,792
Because I don't think we're doing well right now.

194
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,965
I came here because

195
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,243
when I got that letter...

196
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,646
...it dawned on me

197
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,844
that you and Ginger are the only family that I have left.

198
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,387
We have such a short amount of time with people.

199
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:25,252
I just want us to enjoy each other

200
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:30,729
and try to be happy as a family while we are here.

201
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,733
I want to be happy, too, but...

202
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:46,514
I was thinking you should come up to Oregon with me.

203
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,748
I have to go up there

204
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:52,146
and pack up all my dad's stuff in a truck.

205
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,853
Why don't we all go together?

206
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:59,622
We'd spend the whole summer up there.

207
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:01,727
I think it'd be good for us.

208
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,700
It really is stunning.

209
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,141
There's this valley not far from the farm.

210
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,708
It's between these mountains.

211
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,042
And no matter how many times you see it,

212
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,387
the view makes you feel like everything's gonna be okay.

213
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:28,358
I want you and Ginger to see it.

214
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,888
It sounds nice, but I can't just leave work.

215
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,094
No, yeah, but you can work remotely.

216
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,722
Just take some time off.

217
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:36,959
Ginger would love that.

218
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:38,132
You could spend some time with her.

219
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:39,435
You can work on your book.

220
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,868
Yeah, I don't...

221
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:45,734
I don't even know if I'm good at that anymore.

222
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,576
You're a great writer. Come on.

223
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:54,076
I meant at spending time with my daughter.

224
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,358
She...

225
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,761
She relates to you so much more than me.

226
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,700
You are an incredible mother.

227
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,201
You are.

228
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:22,742
Come with me.

229
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,042
Okay, okay, I've got one.

230
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,844
Mm, do you live in water?

231
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:57,406
Nope.

232
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,608
Okay.

233
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:02,280
Do you live in the forest?

234
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,285
Sometimes.

235
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,184
Mm, can you fly?

236
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,991
Nope.

237
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,456
Do you walk on four legs?

238
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:11,686
- Yes. -Yeah?

239
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,159
Oh, are you a deer?

240
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:14,660
Uh... no.

241
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:16,864
Uh, are you a bear?

242
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,167
No.

243
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,700
Are you a dog?

244
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,128
No.

245
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,137
No. I just don't know what...

246
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:23,666
Don't know the answer.

247
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,899
- No, I'm a fawn. - A fawn?

248
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,477
- Yeah. - I said deer.

249
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,644
- A fawn is not a deer. -It's-it's...

250
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,872
- It's not. - What? It's literally a baby deer.

251
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,316
It's not.

252
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,381
And fawns live in the forest. Hello.

253
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:35,715
They do sometimes, but sometimes

254
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,311
they're in people's backyards, so...

255
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:38,718
-Oh. Oh. -What? That's...

256
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,481
Oh, you are a cheater. You know what?

257
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:42,020
- That's it. You know what's coming? - Don't, Daddy. Stop.

258
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:43,425
- Daddy, stop. No, Mommy. -Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

259
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:45,056
- Tell Daddy he's being immature. - Uh-oh.

260
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:48,131
Hey, hey, I can be just as immature as he can.

261
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,729
Mommy, stop it. Stop, Mommy.

262
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:51,325
What makes you think I'm so mature?

263
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,035
- Huh? Huh? -Stop it, Mommy. Stop.

264
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,404
Please, Mommy, stop it.

265
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,573
- Mommy, stop it. -Please?

266
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,042
Please, Mommy, stop.

267
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:03,543
Wait, is this it? Shit.

268
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:06,076
- Dad. - Sorry, honey. Shivers.

269
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,916
Let me check the map here.

270
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:16,218
I have no service.

271
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:18,225
Me, either.

272
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:24,897
This does look familiar, though.

273
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,232
Can I see?

274
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:34,569
There's someone in that tree house.

275
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,936
Where?

276
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,110
Over there.

277
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:39,912
She's right-- there's someone inside that thing.

278
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:44,719
Oh.

279
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,624
Uh, let's go, Blake.

280
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,821
No, it's okay.

281
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,729
No, he has a gun.

282
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,730
Charlotte, everyone around here has a gun.

283
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,800
Blake, can-can you just please drive?

284
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,366
-Evening. -Hey.

285
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,444
Where you guys headed?

286
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,680
Uh, I'm looking for my dad's farm.

287
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,807
I just, I haven't been up here in a while. I forgot...

288
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:15,281
Who's your dad?

289
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,147
Uh... Grady.

290
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,886
Lovell.

291
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,890
You've been gone a long time, Blake.

292
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,161
Wait, do I... do I know you?

293
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,765
I'm Derek. I'm Dan Kiel's son.

294
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:33,596
Right.

295
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,602
Oh, Derek. Shit.

296
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,670
-Dad. - Oh, sorry.

297
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:39,409
Yeah, no, I remember you.

298
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,545
How are you? It's good to see you.

299
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,839
Not many of us left living up here anymore.

300
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:47,877
Not really a part of the world.

301
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:50,015
Yeah. I-I'd agree with that.

302
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:54,988
You might not remember this, but, uh, for the most part,

303
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,119
we don't like to be out after dark on the mountain.

304
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,694
There's no power grid, no lights.

305
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,356
Oh. I-I thought that was just my dad.

306
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,162
Uh, you know, I'm actually a little lost.

307
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:07,131
You know, I-I was sure that this was his driveway.

308
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,540
It's not.

309
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:11,975
Really?

310
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,676
It's mine.

311
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,173
Oh.

312
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:19,048
Yeah, okay.

313
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,616
Well, sorry.

314
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,445
The usual road to Grady's is cut off.

315
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,220
I'll take you there, get you settled in quicker.

316
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,553
Okay.

317
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:33,189
Blake, no. No, absolutely not.

318
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,696
- It's fine. Let him show us. - No, he...

319
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,533
Why can't he just tell us where it is?

320
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,196
- He's standing there now. - What, so...

321
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,501
- Just open the door, Char. - What are you talk...

322
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:40,832
- He's opening it. - Well, stop...

323
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,540
Hi. Hi.

324
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,334
Hi. Uh, no, no, no.

325
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,909
It's okay. I-I'll just go to the back.

326
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:53,375
Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,752
Watch your feet.

328
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,451
Just go straight on a ways.

329
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,554
Hey there, cutie.

330
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:09,426
Uh, Derek, that's Ginger and my wife Charlotte.

331
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:10,892
Hi.

332
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:31,480
How long you planning on staying?

333
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,987
-Not too long. -A little while.

334
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:43,792
It's definitely an acquired taste.

335
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:48,166
There are things you have to come to terms with up here.

336
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,070
Animals.

337
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:53,644
Diseases.

338
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:58,880
Well, we're, we're pretty tough people.

339
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,478
Is that so?

340
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,757
To me, you don't seem so tough.

341
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,262
That's a good thing.

342
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,792
Means you got a good life.

343
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,492
You're healthy, safe.

344
00:27:23,104 --> 00:27:25,269
Your dad's place is just up ahead.

345
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,969
What do you do for a living, Blake?

346
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,646
I'm a writer.

347
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,716
I'm between jobs right now, though.

348
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,014
So... I'm a dad

349
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:40,185
to that monster in the back.

350
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,128
I'm a journalist.

351
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:07,542
I bet you look at them every day and wonder how you got so lucky

352
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,918
to have such a smart and beautiful family.

353
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,450
I do.

354
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,789
Shit.

355
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:42,181
Oh.

356
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,355
Oh.

357
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,390
Ginger? Are you okay?

358
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,489
I'm okay.

359
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,860
Char, are you okay?

360
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,461
Hey, are you hurt anywhere?

361
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:55,089
Are you okay? Ginger?

362
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,632
Charlotte, are you hurt?

363
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,527
-No. -Huh?

364
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:00,834
Derek, are you okay?

365
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,439
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no!

366
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,534
Oh, shit!

367
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,278
Okay. We got to get out of this thing.

368
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,781
Ginger. Ginger.

369
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,109
-No, no, no. - Ginger, look at me.

370
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:13,707
No, please. Please, no.

371
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:14,614
You got to climb through the window.

372
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,216
Look at me, Ginger.

373
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,953
Climb through the window. You can do it, honey.

374
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,889
No, Daddy, I'm scared I'm gonna fall.

375
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,625
- You'll be okay. You'll be okay. - I'm gonna fall.

376
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,156
I'm gonna fall. I'm gonna fall.

377
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,828
It's okay. Just get onto the top.

378
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,760
Just stay right there.

379
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,597
Just sit right there, honey.

380
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:34,398
Just stay there, honey. Mommy's coming.

381
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,808
Charlotte, go.

382
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:43,242
You okay?

383
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:46,044
Stay right there. I'm coming.

384
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:48,379
I...

385
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,323
Okay.

386
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,558
We got to get down. Wait here.

387
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,570
Come on.

388
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:14,835
Ginger, honey, you have to go.

389
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,368
Come on. I'm gonna catch you.

390
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:20,141
Okay. All right, Charlotte, come on.

391
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:23,570
Are you okay?

392
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:24,680
- No, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah?

393
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:26,046
Ginger, are you hurt at all?

394
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:27,544
-No. -Okay, come on.

395
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,618
We got to go. We have to find the house.

396
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,017
Watch your step. Come on, honey.

397
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:31,048
We got to move quick.

398
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:33,516
Where it's safer. Come on.

399
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:36,025
Careful, honey. Careful, careful, careful.

400
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,528
- Daddy, I'm tired. - What?

401
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:39,893
- I can't go. - Okay.

402
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:43,366
Charlotte.

403
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,862
Okay, honey.

404
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,295
Quick.

405
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:52,001
Come on, I recognize this.

406
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,504
We're close.

407
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:55,007
I'm gonna put you down here, honey, okay?

408
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:57,070
- Okay. - Give me your hand.

409
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,309
Come on.

410
00:31:58,444 --> 00:31:59,481
- Come on. -Careful.

411
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,285
Be careful.

412
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,719
Come on. Come on.

413
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:06,579
This is it.

414
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,956
Run.

415
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,395
Run, honey.

416
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,063
Go, honey.

417
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,433
Come on.

418
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,267
Come on. Come on.

419
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,069
Come on.

420
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,207
Daddy, hurry up.

421
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:28,742
Daddy, hurry up!

422
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:30,107
Come on. Get inside.

423
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:48,926
Wait. Wait.

424
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,008
- Stay right here. - Daddy, where are you going?

425
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,370
- I'll be right back. - Daddy. Daddy.

426
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:02,775
- Stay with Mommy. - Daddy.

427
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,715
Okay.

428
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:44,405
Shit.

429
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,805
Daddy.

430
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,142
Hi.

431
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:17,811
Mm. It's okay.

432
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:19,413
We're safe.

433
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,815
I want to go home.

434
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,458
I know.

435
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,820
We will.

436
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,164
We just can't go outside right now. Lay down.

437
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:37,995
We just have to wait until the morning.

438
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,763
Okay?

439
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:28,145
No, don't go anywhere.

440
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:31,518
Okay, okay. I'm here.

441
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,189
I'm not going anywhere.

442
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,853
I'm gonna be right here. Right here.

443
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,694
Is that man dead?

444
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:46,159
The man who came out the tree house?

445
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:50,130
I don't know.

446
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,942
Most likely, he did die.

447
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm so sorry that this happened to you.

448
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:10,726
It's my job to protect you.

449
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,724
And I didn't.

450
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,399
I've put you through something very scary.

451
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,400
And I'd never be able to forgive myself

452
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,474
if this stayed with you.

453
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:30,280
You know? If it scarred you.

454
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:36,451
You know, sometimes when you're a daddy,

455
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,154
you're so scared of your kids getting scars,

456
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,455
you become the thing that scars 'em.

457
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,473
Hey, what am I thinking right now?

458
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,912
"I love my little girl."

459
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:11,948
That's incredible.

460
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,720
You must be able to read minds,

461
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:18,053
because that's exactly what I was thinking.

462
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,299
Word for word.

463
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:25,093
Okay.

464
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,331
I love you.

465
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,794
I'll be right here.

466
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,670
Remember, that's my job.

467
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:33,002
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

468
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:39,382
I think we should, um...

469
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,176
I think we should cover the front door,

470
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,650
'cause if that thing... if it keeps trying to get in,

471
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:45,487
the whole door can come off the hinges.

472
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,020
What was it?

473
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:49,754
What?

474
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:52,285
What the fuck was that thing, Blake?

475
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:54,664
I don't know.

476
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,829
I know it sounded like an animal...

477
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:02,801
but I looked right at it when we almost hit it,

478
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:08,569
and I swear to God it was standing up on two feet,

479
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:10,072
like a person.

480
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:30,433
Blake.

481
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,905
Is that gonna hold?

482
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,142
Maybe.

483
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,590
I think we should try to call somebody for help.

484
00:39:57,994 --> 00:39:59,319
How?

485
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,107
Hello? Test.

486
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:16,836
Hello. This is Lovell 819.

487
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:18,272
Can anyone hear me?

488
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:20,606
Hello?

489
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:22,511
Hell...

490
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:34,096
Jesus, what is that smell?

491
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,389
Hmm? What? What'd you say?

492
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:04,461
Hello?

493
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:06,819
Hello?

494
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,799
Well, I found something to eat.

495
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,269
My dad's jerky.

496
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,345
My jaw. I must've hit it on the steering wheel.

497
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:44,534
Oh, fuck.

498
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,646
Here. Here.

499
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:04,009
Oh, my God.

500
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,883
Okay. Come on. Sit down.

501
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:08,050
Just sit. It's okay.

502
00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:10,692
Just lift your arm.

503
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:18,260
God.

504
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,707
I think I cut it on the window in the truck.

505
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,303
I-I don't... I don't know.

506
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:31,713
This doesn't look like you got cut by glass.

507
00:42:33,547 --> 00:42:36,344
Okay. Okay. Um...

508
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,722
Lift your arm up.

509
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,021
All right, j-just try a little bit. Just try.

510
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:11,478
Thank you.

511
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:14,888
Keep trying the CB radio for me.

512
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:17,627
Okay?

513
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:40,448
Jesus, Ginger.

514
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,181
I'm sorry I woke you, honey.

515
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,115
Just go back to bed, okay? You need to get your rest.

516
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:46,986
Ginger.

517
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:49,591
Will you listen to me, please?

518
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,189
Go back to bed. It's almost midnight.

519
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,557
Hey.

520
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,639
Did you reach anyone on the CB?

521
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:11,311
I-I don't...

522
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,850
I'll be done in a minute.

523
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:23,286
How odd.

524
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,404
Ow.

525
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:16,612
Shh.

526
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,939
- Charlotte. - Blake. Blake.

527
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:25,547
Blake.

528
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,690
Mommy.

529
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,189
Mommy.

530
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:32,652
- Get back! Get back! - Mommy. Mommy.

531
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:34,426
Get back!

532
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:39,998
Blake. Blake.

533
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,031
Char?

534
00:52:43,753 --> 00:52:45,622
Can you read me?

535
00:52:51,762 --> 00:52:53,664
Can anybody hear?

536
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,597
Hello?

537
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:03,504
Can anybody hear me?

538
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,872
This is Charlotte Lovell.

539
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:09,074
If someone can hear me, please respond.

540
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,012
My-my husband is, uh, sick.

541
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:16,716
Um, if-if anyone can, uh, can hear me, uh,

542
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:19,821
pl-please call someone to help.

543
00:53:19,956 --> 00:53:23,123
We were attacked by some kind of animal,

544
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:28,897
and I-I think my, um, husband was infected by it.

545
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,898
He's...

546
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:35,067
He's not himself,

547
00:53:35,203 --> 00:53:39,276
and, um, he can't, he can't talk, um...

548
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:41,382
Yeah, uh, he doesn't,

549
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,749
he doesn't seem to know he's sick, but, um...

550
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,585
i-if someone can hear what I'm saying, please help.

551
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,021
Uh, hello?

552
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:52,651
Hello?

553
00:53:55,062 --> 00:53:56,925
Goddamn it!

554
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:48,812
I'm so worried about you.

555
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,149
I don't know what to do.

556
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:08,969
Oh, my God.

557
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,201
Oh, my God. Come on.

558
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:12,035
Let's get you upstairs.

559
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:13,468
Come on.

560
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:07,160
Here. Can you, um...

561
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:08,997
Can you write it down?

562
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,433
Just tell me what's wrong.

563
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,462
No.

564
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:46,226
You're sick-- that's all-- but we're gonna fix you.

565
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,938
Blake...

566
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,915
You're gonna get better, because Ginger needs you.

567
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,448
I need you.

568
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:06,081
I can't do this without you.

569
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:09,590
What I-I really want to say is...

570
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:13,820
...is that...

571
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:16,663
is that I love you, Blake.

572
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:22,933
I don't want to do anything in my life without you.

573
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,102
You're my best friend.

574
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,370
I love you so much.

575
00:57:51,562 --> 00:57:54,701
Ch-Charlotte...

576
00:57:57,272 --> 00:57:59,398
What is happening?

577
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:03,776
I can't understand you.

578
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,447
What... what are you saying?

579
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:26,997
What's wrong with him?

580
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:31,830
Hi.

581
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:33,942
It's okay.

582
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,973
Come here.

583
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,180
Daddy's not feeling well, but in the morning,

584
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:47,688
we're gonna take him to the doctor as soon as we can, okay?

585
00:58:51,657 --> 00:58:54,024
Are you sick, Dada?

586
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,800
What is this?

587
00:59:05,935 --> 00:59:07,970
Why are you bleeding?

588
00:59:08,106 --> 00:59:10,169
Why is Daddy's arm like that?

589
00:59:10,305 --> 00:59:12,742
- Ginger, um... - Help him, Mommy.

590
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:15,507
Baby, go to the next room, okay?

591
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,882
CHARLOTTE Oh, my God.

592
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,648
Blake.

593
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:23,173
Mommy?

594
01:02:12,488 --> 01:02:14,154
Okay, come on. Come on.

595
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,925
Out. Just come out. It's okay.

596
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,098
It's okay, it's okay.

597
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,405
This way, honey.

598
01:02:32,372 --> 01:02:33,639
Okay, come on. Come on.

599
01:02:51,461 --> 01:02:53,835
Mommy, what if he...

600
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:41,338
Come on. Come on.

601
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,836
Come on.

602
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,149
Oh, my God.

603
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,702
Okay, okay.

604
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:14,507
Okay.

605
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:34,892
Mommy, he's coming.

606
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:36,289
Up here.

607
01:05:36,424 --> 01:05:37,728
Quick. Climb up here.

608
01:05:55,183 --> 01:05:57,044
Stay still.

609
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:51,299
Mommy, please.

610
01:06:51,435 --> 01:06:53,266
Mommy, please, I'm gonna fall.

611
01:07:48,624 --> 01:07:50,597
Come on.

612
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,951
- You left him. - What?

613
01:08:19,086 --> 01:08:20,924
You left Daddy outside. He's gonna get hurt.

614
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,854
- He's gonna die! You just left him outside to die! - No. No.

615
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:25,094
No, he was trying to protect you.

616
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:32,470
Stay here.

617
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:44,608
Is it Daddy?

618
01:08:46,884 --> 01:08:48,523
He's sick.

619
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,257
He needs us.

620
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:53,161
Open the door, Mommy.

621
01:09:56,186 --> 01:09:58,187
Daddy?

622
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:29,180
Daddy?

623
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,487
Daddy...

624
01:10:32,623 --> 01:10:36,693
what am I thinking right now?

625
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,459
What am I thinking?

626
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:45,031
I was thinking that I love you.

627
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:53,947
Daddy?

628
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,784
Dad? Dad, can you hear me?

629
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,883
Daddy? Daddy, are you okay?

630
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,261
I love you so much.

631
01:11:22,435 --> 01:11:25,109
-Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up.

632
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,809
Come on. Come on.

633
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,116
Daddy.

634
01:13:08,181 --> 01:13:09,516
Get in. Get in.

635
01:13:10,811 --> 01:13:12,677
- Get in. - Mommy!

636
01:13:42,678 --> 01:13:44,419
Mommy!

637
01:14:55,786 --> 01:14:57,485
GINGER Mommy!

638
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,277
Mommy?

639
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:06,687
Why did Daddy have to get sick?

640
01:17:08,816 --> 01:17:10,449
Um...

641
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,960
Daddy's father...

642
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:21,300
A while ago, he went out... into the forest,

643
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,868
and he never came back.

644
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:28,231
Everybody thought he was dead, but...

645
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:30,909
I think he just got sick.

646
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:34,110
Sick like Daddy?

647
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:36,976
Yeah.

648
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,353
I think he may have...

649
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,015
given his sickness to Daddy.

650
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,615
I want him back the way he was.

651
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:49,691
I know. Me, too, honey.

652
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:51,831
I-I want him back, too.

653
01:17:56,772 --> 01:18:00,235
I'm always going to be here for you.

654
01:18:11,682 --> 01:18:13,820
No. Mommy.

655
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:16,647
Mommy.

656
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:43,140
It's okay.

657
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:25,675
Get back! Get back! Get back!

658
01:20:28,154 --> 01:20:29,953
Please, Daddy, you're scaring me.

659
01:20:30,088 --> 01:20:31,916
No.

660
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,822
No. No.

661
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:37,689
Mommy.

662
01:20:45,067 --> 01:20:46,472
In here. Come.

663
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,407
Come on. Come on.

664
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:02,019
Hurry, Mommy. He's coming.

665
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:03,148
Here. Just hold this.

666
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:04,950
Take it.

667
01:26:18,598 --> 01:26:20,306
Come on. Come on.

668
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:28,644
All right. All right. Come on. Come on.

669
01:28:30,662 --> 01:28:32,603
Mommy.

670
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:39,306
He wants this to be over.

671
01:30:02,891 --> 01:30:04,431
Oh, Blake.

672
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,913
