1
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,017
<b>Most of the time
it's like, I don't know,</b>

2
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,101
<b>it's like there's this thick</b>

3
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,833
<b>black cloud covering everything.</b>

4
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,184
<b>Like we see the world, but we</b>

5
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,416
<b>don't really
see the world, you know?</b>

6
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,500
<b>We're all just
stumbling around, directionless,</b>

7
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,708
<b>no sense of
meaning, no sense of purpose.</b>

8
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,208
<b>I know that might sound
super depressing, but honestly,</b>

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,583
<b>I think it's a good thing.</b>

10
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,000
<b>Because it makes us
appreciate the other times.</b>

11
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,976
<b>Those brief, transcendent</b>

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,666
<b>moments when
the lights flicker on,</b>

13
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,559
<b>the black cloud parts, and you</b>

14
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,375
<b>see the world
for what it really is.</b>

15
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:50,875
<b>And suddenly there's meaning.</b>

16
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,708
<b>Suddenly there's purpose.</b>

17
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,708
<b>So, uh, do you... oh, shit,</b>

18
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,958
<b>shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.</b>

19
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:15,916
<b>If you're lucky, you'll</b>

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,125
<b>experience this
once in your lifetime.</b>

21
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,416
<b>God damn, that
was, uh, that was smooth.</b>

22
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,125
<b>For me, so smooth.</b>

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
<b>It happened twice.</b>

24
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,208
<b>The first was
the day I met Josh.</b>

25
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,208
<b>Uh, I'm Josh.</b>

26
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,458
<b>I'm Lyra.</b>

27
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,666
<b>And the second,</b>

28
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,916
<b>the day I killed him.</b>

29
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,208
<b>Iris, wake up.</b>

30
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,583
<b>Ooh, it's a beautiful day</b>

31
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,583
<b>Ooh, I never
felt this way before</b>

32
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,208
<b>Nicely be out.</b>

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
<b>Ooh.</b>

34
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,208
<b>How long was I out?</b>

35
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,416
<b>Uh, for a while.</b>

36
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,875
<b>Yeah, you were
zonked out there pretty good.</b>

37
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,333
<b>I was having the
most wonderful dream.</b>

38
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,416
<b>Yeah? About me?</b>

39
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
<b>That is very
presumptuous, but...</b>

40
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:16,750
<b>Yes.</b>

41
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,458
<b>Yes, you knew it.</b>

42
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:19,958
<b>Was it sexy times?</b>

43
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,642
<b>No. You deviant.</b>

44
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,392
<b>A little bit of sexy times?</b>

45
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:22,892
<b>No.</b>

46
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:23,560
<b>Was my shirt off?</b>

47
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:26,208
<b>No, I was
dreaming about the day we met.</b>

48
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,291
<b>It was also perfect.</b>

49
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,125
<b>Remember how perfect it all was?</b>

50
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,333
<b>Yeah, no, no,
how could I forget?</b>

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,708
<b>Supermarket, the oranges.</b>

52
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,809
<b>What road is this?</b>

53
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,125
<b>It's not showing up in the GPS.</b>

54
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,616
<b>I don't think this is the road.</b>

55
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,235
<b>I think this
might be the driveway.</b>

56
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,250
<b>Oh, it's a beautiful day</b>

57
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,333
<b>Oh, I never felt this way before</b>

58
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,875
<b>I'll give you some more</b>

59
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,208
<b>Oh, well, I'm feeling so fine</b>

60
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:21,333
<b>You have
arrived at your destination.</b>

61
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,791
<b>Thank you, Josh's car.</b>

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
<b>Thank you, car.</b>

63
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
<b>Pop the trunk.</b>

64
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,333
<b>Pop in the trunk.</b>

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,916
<b>Fuck me.</b>

66
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:35,935
<b>Cat called this place a</b>

67
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,416
<b>little rustic
cabin in the woods.</b>

68
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,727
<b>I think we might have differing</b>

69
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,041
<b>opinions on the
meaning of the word "cabin."</b>

70
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,541
<b>Also rustic.</b>

71
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,833
<b>Also little.</b>

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
<b>What?</b>

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,142
<b>Iris, come
on. You know you can't</b>

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,406
<b>lie to me.
Tell me what's wrong.</b>

75
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,791
<b>I'm gonna do something stupid.</b>

76
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,185
<b>I'm gonna say something</b>

77
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,601
<b>stupid. I'm
gonna embarrass you.</b>

78
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,434
<b>They're gonna laugh
at me. They're gonna hate me.</b>

79
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,434
<b>They already hate me.</b>

80
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,352
<b>Jesus Christ, Iris.</b>

81
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,892
<b>We've been
planning this trip for months,</b>

82
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,309
<b>and this is all
just coming out now,</b>

83
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,208
<b>like 20 feet
from the fucking door?</b>

84
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,041
<b>Look, look. Hey.</b>

85
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,498
<b>My friends don't hate you.</b>

86
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,708
<b>Cat does.</b>

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,291
<b>Yeah, maybe,
but cat hates everybody.</b>

88
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,833
<b>I just don't want
to screw everything up.</b>

89
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,745
<b>Come on, Beboop. You're
not gonna screw everything up.</b>

90
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,708
<b>Just relax.</b>

91
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,166
<b>You know? Don't
be all moopy and weird.</b>

92
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,375
<b>Just remember to...</b>

93
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,958
<b>remember to smile and act happy.</b>

94
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,000
<b>Okay?</b>

95
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:38,833
<b>All right.</b>

96
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,375
<b>Yay! You
made it fucking funny!</b>

97
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:46,935
<b>Okay, so when you said</b>

98
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,791
<b>"remote," I
thought you meant, like,</b>

99
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,325
<b>a couple miles off the highway.</b>

100
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,185
<b>I didn't realize you meant</b>

101
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,583
<b>edge of fucking civilization.</b>

102
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,976
<b>Oh, don't be so
dramatic, Josh. It's not that far.</b>

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
<b>Okay. Hard to disagree.</b>

104
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,125
<b>Um, hello, Iris.</b>

105
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
<b>Hi, Cat. It's
so good to see you.</b>

106
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,166
<b>So good.</b>

107
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,267
<b>Everyone, look who I found.</b>

108
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,291
<b>Hey, hey!</b>

109
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,375
<b>Look at you in the
kitchen, man. Look at me. Welcome.</b>

110
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,809
<b>I would, um, give you a hug,</b>

111
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,083
<b>but I've got scallop hands.</b>

112
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,726
<b>Sorry. Okay?
Well, I appreciate that.</b>

113
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,250
<b>Where's that?</b>

114
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,416
<b>Oh, there he is!</b>

115
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,583
<b>Joshy boy, Joshy boy</b>

116
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,041
<b>Hey, buddy.</b>

117
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,165
<b>How'd you two girl get in?</b>

118
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,250
<b>Hi. Hi. How are you?</b>

119
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,875
<b>I'm good.
Uh, I'm, um, drunk.</b>

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,208
<b>Good. This is good.</b>

121
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,458
<b>Oh, and Josh,
you remember Sergei?</b>

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,375
<b>Privyat.</b>

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,958
<b>Hey! Sergei,
nice to see you again.</b>

124
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,208
<b>Likewise, my
friend. Likewise.</b>

125
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,833
<b>And this
beautiful creation must be Iris.</b>

126
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:54,750
<b>Hello.</b>

127
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,458
<b>Such pleasure. I have
heard a lot about this one.</b>

128
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,208
<b>Really? All good, I hope.</b>

129
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,267
<b>Your lake house, it's...</b>

130
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,491
<b>It's
really... It's incredible.</b>

131
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,625
<b>Yeah. Yeah.
It's so secluded.</b>

132
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,184
<b>I mean, I
think the last place we</b>

133
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,351
<b>passed was,
like, ten miles back.</b>

134
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,208
<b>Seventeen.
And I paid for this.</b>

135
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,998
<b>But I have a seat
that's not come cheap, my friends.</b>

136
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,809
<b>Not cheap at all.</b>

137
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,267
<b>Don't tell me you're
on the whole fucking lake.</b>

138
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,500
<b>No, no, no. Don't be
silly. Just all land around it.</b>

139
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,434
<b>But let's get you guys a drink.</b>

140
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,208
<b>What you like?
Beer, cocktail, wine?</b>

141
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,958
<b>I'm fine. More than
anything, I just need a shower.</b>

142
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,083
<b>Katunak, what room they are in?</b>

143
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,958
<b>Up the stairs, down
the hall. Last one on the left.</b>

144
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,625
<b>I'll see you later.</b>

145
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,083
<b>Smile.</b>

146
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,583
<b>Get happy.</b>

147
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
<b>Okay,
continue. Continue the story.</b>

148
00:08:57,251 --> 00:08:59,976
<b>So, I was wearing this</b>

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,583
<b>ridiculously
elaborate Dracula costume.</b>

150
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,601
<b>And I didn't know a
single person, as I said.</b>

151
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,226
<b>So I'm standing by the snack</b>

152
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,559
<b>table, just munching on carrots</b>

153
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,416
<b>and something
that looked like hummus.</b>

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,333
<b>It was not hummus.</b>

155
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,142
<b>It was not
hummus, I don't think.</b>

156
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,375
<b>But I feel a tap on my shoulder.</b>

157
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,416
<b>And so I turn around.</b>

158
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,976
<b>And there's this green, puffy</b>

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,875
<b>dinosaur just staring me down.</b>

160
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,392
<b>And inside its
head, I hear this very,</b>

161
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,166
<b>very muffled,
very annoyed voice say,</b>

162
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,375
<b>"You're
standing on my tail."</b>

163
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,767
<b>So I turn around, I
look down, and sure enough,</b>

164
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,791
<b>I am standing on
his little dino tail.</b>

165
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:51,333
<b>So I step off and
apologize, and he takes his head off.</b>

166
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,267
<b>And I'm looking at the most</b>

167
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,208
<b>beautiful man that
I've ever seen in my life.</b>

168
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,375
<b>So did you meet this
beautiful man after you met Eli?</b>

169
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,208
<b>Okay, no way. Shut up.</b>

170
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,059
<b>Was that a
scallop? That was a scallop.</b>

171
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,333
<b>That actually hit
me. Yeah. I took baseball.</b>

172
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:07,684
<b>Yes, you did.</b>

173
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,708
<b>When did you know?</b>

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,750
<b>I know what.</b>

175
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,125
<b>That... He was the one.</b>

176
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,416
<b>No. Right then and there.</b>

177
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,166
<b>I know it's gonna
sound cheesy, but the moment...</b>

178
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,560
<b>The moment we locked out of</b>

179
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:24,904
<b>something
inside of me, it just...</b>

180
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,833
<b>clicked into place.</b>

181
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,041
<b>It doesn't sound
cheesy at all. I get it.</b>

182
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,434
<b>It's like
there's this piece of you</b>

183
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,309
<b>that you didn't
even know is broken,</b>

184
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
<b>and then...</b>

185
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,125
<b>suddenly
it's... it's fixed.</b>

186
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,583
<b>And you're
staring at this stranger,</b>

187
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,208
<b>this person
you've never met before,</b>

188
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,958
<b>and you know...</b>

189
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,560
<b>that for the rest of your</b>

190
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,791
<b>life, you will
do whatever it takes</b>

191
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,750
<b>to make this person happy.</b>

192
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,458
<b>Right? Yeah. Yeah.</b>

193
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,208
<b>Yeah, totally.</b>

194
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,958
<b>Patrick, this food
is unbelievable. Thank you.</b>

195
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,601
<b>Thank you,
Sergey. That's so</b>

196
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,083
<b>nice of you.
I'm glad you like it.</b>

197
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,892
<b>He spoils me.
I swear I've gained</b>

198
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,458
<b>like 10 pounds
since we started dating.</b>

199
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:26,583
<b>Only 10?</b>

200
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,916
<b>Shut the fuck up.</b>

201
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,958
<b>So, Sergey, what
kind of work do you do?</b>

202
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:38,500
<b>Oh, you know, I
have fingers in many pots.</b>

203
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,291
<b>My hands are
not clean, my friend.</b>

204
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,583
<b>It's a... a
very dirty business.</b>

205
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,750
<b>Sergey
seems... he seems nice.</b>

206
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,208
<b>Oh, yeah. He's got
everything you want in a man.</b>

207
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,958
<b>He's rich,
intelligent. He's got a beautiful wife.</b>

208
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,875
<b>Wife? He...
Sergey's married?</b>

209
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:09,833
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

210
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,208
<b>But you love...
you love each other.</b>

211
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,684
<b>With love? No.
No, no, no, no, no.</b>

212
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,916
<b>You'd have to think
of me as a human being first.</b>

213
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,750
<b>I don't understand.</b>

214
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,291
<b>I'm an
accessory. Like his fucking car.</b>

215
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,101
<b>I wear what he wants, eat what</b>

216
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,958
<b>he wants, fuck when he wants.</b>

217
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:35,916
<b>But...</b>

218
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,500
<b>Look who I'm talking to.</b>

219
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,208
<b>Do you not like me, Kat?</b>

220
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,291
<b>You know, it's not
that I don't like you, Iris.</b>

221
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,166
<b>It's the idea of you.</b>

222
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,541
<b>You made me feel so...</b>

223
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,291
<b>replaceable.</b>

224
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,708
<b>Replaceable?</b>

225
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,541
<b>Nobody could replace you, Kat.</b>

226
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,208
<b>I mean, you're Kat.</b>

227
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,750
<b>You're so
fearless. It's inspiring.</b>

228
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,750
<b>I wish I could
be more like you, but...</b>

229
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,541
<b>You know, I
wasn't built that way.</b>

230
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,416
<b>I just...</b>

231
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,227
<b>I feel like there's always</b>

232
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,125
<b>something inside
of me holding me back.</b>

233
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,041
<b>No, no, no.</b>

234
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

235
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,541
<b>Come on.</b>

236
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:06,666
<b>Okay, get out
of the pitch. Get out.</b>

237
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,708
<b>Oh, God.</b>

238
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,250
<b>Come on.</b>

239
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,750
<b>You two, put that phone
away. Put it away and get up.</b>

240
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,666
<b>Get your asses up. Come on.</b>

241
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,208
<b>Come on.</b>

242
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:04,250
<b>Hey, sweetie.</b>

243
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,583
<b>I'm so glad we did this.</b>

244
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,875
<b>Being here with
you is just perfect.</b>

245
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,416
<b>I don't know.</b>

246
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,000
<b>I'm sorry if I was
being weird or mopey earlier.</b>

247
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,333
<b>I just want
you to be happy, Josh.</b>

248
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,208
<b>That's all.</b>

249
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,833
<b>All right. Go to sleep.</b>

250
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,875
<b>It's such a gorgeous day out.</b>

251
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,083
<b>Where's the weather?</b>

252
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,476
<b>It's currently
72 degrees, but the</b>

253
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,791
<b>93% chance of
rain in the evening.</b>

254
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,333
<b>It never gets old.</b>

255
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:47,791
<b>You almost ready?</b>

256
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,642
<b>I'm sorry, babe. I think
I need some time to shower and</b>

257
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,267
<b>pound a few gallons of coffee.</b>

258
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,791
<b>Why don't you head
down there by yourself?</b>

259
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,708
<b>It was your idea.</b>

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,476
<b>You said you wanted a nice,</b>

261
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,142
<b>relaxing morning by the lake.</b>

262
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,434
<b>I know, but that's before</b>

263
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,934
<b>the hangover caught up with me.</b>

264
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,000
<b>Last night was a lot.</b>

265
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,375
<b>You'd find that right?</b>

266
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,375
<b>Of course I did, Bebo.</b>

267
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,081
<b>Last night was incredible.</b>

268
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:28,500
<b>You want me to wait?</b>

269
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,625
<b>We can make the shower for two.</b>

270
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,791
<b>No, no, no. That's okay.</b>

271
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,750
<b>You go on ahead.</b>

272
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,633
<b>Enjoy as much of

273
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,333
<b>Okay.</b>

274
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,416
<b>Dobre utre.</b>

275
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,750
<b>Sorry?</b>

276
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,250
<b>That means good morning.</b>

277
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,250
<b>Dobre utre to you too.</b>

279
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,875
<b>Hey, your Russian is not bad.</b>

280
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
<b>It is not good.</b>

281
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,125
<b>But also it is not bad.</b>

282
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,333
<b>Nice view.</b>

283
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,333
<b>Lovely boy to love.</b>

284
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,875
<b>Hmm. You like?</b>

285
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,166
<b>I'm actually
going to head back inside.</b>

286
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,916
<b>So soon?</b>

287
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,208
<b>Yeah.</b>

288
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,976
<b>Josh wasn't
feeling great this morning,</b>

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
<b>so I think I
should check in on him.</b>

290
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,291
<b>Josh's big boy
can take care of himself.</b>

291
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,750
<b>Thay keeps her company.</b>

292
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,666
<b>I really think I should see him.</b>

293
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,041
<b>You like Lake House, yes?</b>

294
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
<b>Yeah.</b>

295
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,583
<b>You enjoy your time here?</b>

296
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
<b>Mm-hmm. Yeah, very much.</b>

297
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,166
<b>Then as guest, please stay.</b>

298
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,958
<b>Keep the soul

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Wonderful.</b>

301
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,541
<b>Oh.</b>

302
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,750
<b>You mind?</b>

303
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,083
<b>Just back and
shoulders is tough to reach.</b>

304
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,458
<b>Don't want to get too tan.</b>

305
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,333
<b>Okay.</b>

306
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,416
<b>Hmm.</b>

307
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,333
<b>And shoulders, please.</b>

308
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,458
<b>Okay.</b>

309
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:54,125
<b>What are you doing?</b>

310
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,458
<b>It's no problem.</b>

311
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,458
<b>This cat's idea.</b>

312
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,166
<b>She tells
Sergey you are down here.</b>

313
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,916
<b>Give Sergey permission.</b>

314
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,208
<b>I'll go with my hand, please.</b>

<b>This is what you do,

316
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,250
<b>Please, please stop.</b>

317
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,375
<b>I was drunk.</b>

318
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,393
<b>I mean, last night.</b>

319
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,684
<b>Yeah, yeah, you
were extremely drunk.</b>

320
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,988
<b>It was crazy.
You were drunk too.</b>

321
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,017
<b>Like more drunk than I am.</b>

322
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:28,226
<b>I was more drunk.</b>

323
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,666
<b>I was more hydrated.</b>

324
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,893
<b>Like it's like this gift.</b>

325
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,677
<b>Like people get
bloated and stuff and not me.</b>

326
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:32,809
<b>Like never happens.</b>

327
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,458
<b>Never gets loaded.</b>

328
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,892
<b>Never. Like
I just like I get</b>

329
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,116
<b>a drink and do whatever I want.</b>

330
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,226
<b>Like I'm looking at dehydrated.</b>

<b>Yeah, it's just
like, what the fuck?</b>

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
<b>Oh shit.</b>

333
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
<b>Iris?</b>

334
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,541
<b>What the fuck?</b>

335
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,833
<b>I didn't mean to.</b>

336
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,291
<b>He forced himself on me.</b>

337
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,083
<b>Who did?</b>

338
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,291
<b>Sergey?</b>

339
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,041
<b>Please.</b>

340

<b>Sergey just want a little taste.</b>

341
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:07,041
<b>I just wanted him to stop.</b>

342
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,083
<b>Oh God, Sergey.</b>

343
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,226
<b>Iris, Iris, look at me.</b>

344
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:17,892
<b>Look at me.</b>

345
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,666
<b>Talk me through it.</b>

346
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,875
<b>What happened?</b>

347
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:27,208
<b>I said stop!</b>

348
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,125
<b>I didn't have a choice.</b>

349
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,208
<b>Sergey.</b>

350
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,750
<b>Bats!</b>

351
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,208
<b>Talker.</b>

352
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,833
<b>He wouldn't let go.</b>

353
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,708
<b>He was choking me, Josh.</b>

354
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,892
<b>And then I...</b>

355
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:07,976
<b>And then you what, Iris?</b>

356
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
<b>Then you what?</b>

357
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,184
<b>He was trying to kill me.</b>

358
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,184
<b>And the only thing I
could think about was that if he</b>

359
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,226
<b>did kill me, I'd
never get to see you again.</b>

360
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,226
<b>And I heard so much more
than the pain of being choked.</b>

361
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,267
<b>I wouldn't let that happen.</b>

362
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,059
<b>I couldn't let
him take me away from you.</b>

363
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,708
<b>I love you so much.</b>

364
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,250
<b>Let's go to sleep.</b>

365
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,791
<b>Are you sure this is gonna hold?</b>

366
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:45,434
<b>Yeah.</b>

367
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:45,977
<b>No, it's fine.</b>

368
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,267
<b>She's not
superhuman or anything.</b>

369
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,011
<b>She's only as
strong as they want her to be.</b>

370
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,208
<b>Hank, I've not.</b>

371
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,416
<b>Hey.</b>

372
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:19,000
<b>Hey.</b>

373
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:20,708
<b>How's she doing?</b>

374
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:21,583
<b>She's asleep.</b>

375
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:22,958
<b>I gave her two Xanax.</b>

376
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,625
<b>Xanax is?</b>

377
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:25,500
<b>Xanai?</b>

378
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:26,185
<b>Whatever. She's asleep.</b>

379
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:27,375
<b>Okay. Good.</b>

380
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:28,333
<b>Good.</b>

381
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,791
<b>So...</b>

382
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,208
<b>What do we do now?</b>

383
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:32,791
<b>Uh...</b>

384
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,851
<b>I mean, the only thing
we can do is call the cops.</b>

385
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,875
<b>We tell them everything.</b>

386
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,666
<b>Right. Yeah.</b>

387
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:38,227
<b>Yeah.</b>

388
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,791
<b>But what about...</b>

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,916
<b>Well,
obviously I'll need to, uh...</b>

390
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,625
<b>You know.</b>

391
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,226
<b>I just don't understand
how this could have happened.</b>

392
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,935
<b>I mean, like, don't they have,</b>

393
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,976
<b>like, safeguards for these guys?</b>

394
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
<b>I have no idea.</b>

395
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,375
<b>Like a glitch, maybe?</b>

396
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,708
<b>Yeah.</b>

397
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,208
<b>Okay.</b>

398
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,250
<b>Okay. So...</b>

399
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,000
<b>I'll call the
cops and you will...</b>

400
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,833
<b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</b>

401
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,708
<b>Sorry, do you mind, um,</b>

402
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,625
<b>taking it
outside just because...</b>

403
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,455
<b>I don't want to say goodbye.</b>

404
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:15,583
<b>Yeah.</b>

405
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,208
<b>Yeah, buddy. Sure.</b>

406
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,416
<b>Thanks.</b>

407
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,083
<b>Iris, wake up.</b>

408
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,583
<b>Be lost without you.</b>

409
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,750
<b>Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. You're okay.</b>

410
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,916
<b>You're okay.
I'm here. Hey, hey.</b>

411
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
<b>Listen to me.</b>

412
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,041
<b>Please.</b>

413
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,601
<b>Why are my hands
tied? Why are my hands tied?</b>

414
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,785
<b>Iris, we didn't have a choice.</b>

415
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,875
<b>We didn't have a choice.</b>

416
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,517
<b>You murdered
Sergei. You remember?</b>

417
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:45,310
<b>No, no, no, no, no.</b>

418
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:47,041
<b>He was
self-defense. He was gonna kill me.</b>

419
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,017
<b>He was gonna kill
me. You gotta believe me.</b>

420
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,500
<b>No, I believe you.</b>

421
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:51,602
<b>Iris, I mean, you couldn't</b>

422
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:52,916
<b>lie to me even if you wanted to.</b>

423
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,185
<b>It's, um...</b>

424
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,583
<b>part of your programming.</b>

425
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,586
<b>Programming? What the
hell are you talking about?</b>

426
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,250
<b>Okay, um...</b>

427
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,142
<b>Sorry, there's just
no delicate way to say this,</b>

428
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,666
<b>so, um, I'm just gonna...</b>

429
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,125
<b>rip the Band-Aid right off.</b>

430
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,458
<b>You're a robot.</b>

431
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,625
<b>Um...</b>

432
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,458
<b>A robot.</b>

433
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,916
<b>More specifically, you're a...</b>

434
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,583
<b>companion robot.</b>

435
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,583
<b>A companion robot?</b>

436
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,291
<b>Yeah, it's like, uh...</b>

437
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,666
<b>I hate the word "fuckbot."</b>

438
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,666
<b>Um, because you do so
much more than that, but, uh...</b>

439
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,958
<b>You're an
emotional support robot.</b>

440
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,625
<b>Bad fucks.</b>

441
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,517
<b>You're joking.
Right. This is just a sick...</b>

442
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,250
<b>Iris, what's the weather?</b>

443
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,726
<b>It's currently 72 degrees with a</b>

444
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,458
<b>93% chance of
rain in the evening.</b>

445
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,541
<b>Are you still not convinced?</b>

446
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,083
<b>Yeah. Okay. Uh...</b>

447
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,333
<b>Let's see.</b>

448
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,351
<b>Iris, do you know
any foreign languages?</b>

449
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,708
<b>Can you speak, say, Spanish?</b>

450
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,625
<b>About Chinese.</b>

451
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,333
<b>Do I need to keep going?</b>

452
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,767
<b>Because I can go, uh...</b>

453
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,231
<b>I can do
Portuguese, I can do Korean,</b>

454
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,333
<b>I can do, uh...</b>

455
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,268
<b>I don't know what "talugu"</b>

456
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,184
<b>is, but apparently you speak it.</b>

457
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,625
<b>I don't understand.</b>

458
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,625
<b>I...</b>

459
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,125
<b>I have memories.</b>

460
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,517
<b>Uh, college, summer jobs.</b>

461
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,916
<b>I've been to Japan twice.</b>

462
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,750
<b>Okay. So what
those are, those are, um...</b>

463
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,958
<b>They're like
outlines of memories.</b>

464
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,301
<b>You know, just
enough to give you a little...</b>

465
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:48,541
<b>backstory.</b>

466
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,517
<b>The day we met in the</b>

467
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,184
<b>grocery store,
you and the oranges,</b>

468
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,059
<b>that is not
an outline of memory.</b>

469
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,059
<b>Yeah, it's
fake. It never happened.</b>

470
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,101
<b>I just randomly picked it from</b>

471
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,333
<b>a drop-down list of meet-cutes.</b>

472
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,631
<b>Could have been
anywhere. It could have been...</b>

473
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,666
<b>dog park, a
bookstore, farmer's market.</b>

474
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,625
<b>It never happened.</b>

475
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,666
<b>Okay, do you, um...</b>

476
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,352
<b>Do you want to know how we</b>

477
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,208
<b>met? Like,
how we really met?</b>

478
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,791
<b>Hey, uh, Josh Beeman?</b>

479
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,726
<b>Yeah. Okay.</b>

480
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,958
<b>That's me.</b>

481
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,750
<b>Come on in. Thank you.</b>

482
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,375
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

483
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,416
<b>How you doing?</b>

484
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,958
<b>Okay, this is
the user agreement.</b>

485
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,435
<b>Just give it a read and then</b>

486
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,000
<b>sign at the
bottom when you're done.</b>

487
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,250
<b>Um...</b>

488
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,333
<b>So, um, what do
I do when she, like,</b>

489
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,625
<b>like boots up or whatever?</b>

490
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,351
<b>Well, once she's
done syncing with your phone,</b>

491
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,695
<b>you'll need to
create a love link.</b>

492
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:05,208
<b>Love link?</b>

493
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:05,666
<b>Yeah.</b>

494
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,102
<b>It establishes the emotional</b>

495
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,375
<b>connection
between you and, uh...</b>

496
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,000
<b>Oh, Iris.</b>

497
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,684
<b>Just follow the vocal
prompts when she wakes up.</b>

498
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,750
<b>It's all pretty intuitive.</b>

499
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:21,791
<b>Do they know
that they're robots?</b>

500
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:23,666
<b>Not at all.</b>

501
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,291
<b>She'll be so fixated on
you, your wants, your needs,</b>

502
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,990
<b>that'll never even occur to her.</b>

503
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,690
<b>The whole
experience is customizable.</b>

504
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,916
<b>You can change your
voice, eye color, intelligence,</b>

505
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,767
<b>and if you ever want to revert</b>

506
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,142
<b>back to her factory settings,</b>

507
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,642
<b>there is a thumbprint
sensor behind her right ear.</b>

508
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,583
<b>Just hold your
thumb there for five seconds.</b>

509
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,083
<b>She'll reset.</b>

510
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,708
<b>You can... you can
change their intelligence?</b>

511
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,208
<b>Yeah, but don't worry.</b>

512
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,351
<b>There is about a
billion government regulations</b>

513
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,351
<b>that force us to limit how</b>

514
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,625
<b>strong and smart they can be.</b>

515
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,017
<b>100% intelligence would be the</b>

516
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,666
<b>equivalent of
an Ivy League grad.</b>

517
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,875
<b>0% would be a
mindless automaton.</b>

518
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,767
<b>It really just depends on</b>

519
00:30:58,791 --> 00:30:59,951
<b>what kind of partner you want.</b>

520
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,726
<b>She can't lie, so
if you ask her a question,</b>

521
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,310
<b>she literally has
to tell you the truth.</b>

522
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,559
<b>And for obvious
reasons, her programming prevents her</b>

<b>Oh, fuck.</b>

<b>Oh, God!</b>

542
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,083
<b>I don't understand.</b>

543
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,458
<b>I feel things.</b>

544
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,541
<b>Anger.</b>

545
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,541
<b>Guilt. Sadness. I...</b>

546
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,642
<b>I know what pain feels like.</b>

547
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:31,666
<b>It's programming.</b>

548
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,583
<b>It's just a way to

549

<b>Everything you
do, your whole life,</b>

550
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,208
<b>it's just an

551
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,833
<b>There we go. Perfect. Okay.</b>

552
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,916
<b>This is just water.</b>

553
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,142
<b>You know, it's from
a reservoir in your body.</b>

554
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,166
<b>It's like wiper fluid.</b>

555
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:51,852
<b>I get it topped off every</b>

<b>time I take
you into get service.</b>

557
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,750
<b>Service? No, you're not.</b>

558
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,750
<b>Iris, it's programmed.</b>

559
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,625
<b>Stop saying that.</b>

560
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,583
<b>Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.</b>

561
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,356
<b>I know this
must be a lot to process.</b>

562
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,333
<b>Okay.</b>

563
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:24,958
<b>Okay, what?</b>

564
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,791
<b>I'm not real.</b>

565
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,083
<b>But I'm still yours.</b>

566
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:34,458
<b>We can get through

567
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,875
<b>I'll do whatever you want.</b>

568
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,958
<b>I'll cook for you,

<b>I can make

571
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:54,083
<b>No. I'm sorry.
Iris, that can't happen.</b>

572
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:55,916
<b>Why not?</b>

573
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,625
<b>Uh, what are you doing?</b>

574
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,351
<b>Nothing. Okay?</b>

575
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,310
<b>What the fuck are you</b>

576
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,125
<b>waiting for?
Shut her down already.</b>

577
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,375
<b>Shut me down? Fuck.</b>

578
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,833
<b>What is she
talking about? Shut me down?</b>

579
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,208
<b>Josh!</b>

580
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,333
<b>Josh!</b>

581
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,750
<b>No, come on.</b>

582
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,083
<b>Josh!</b>

583
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:26,851
<b>You can't do
that, Kat. You can't</b>

584
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,184
<b>tell a robot
you're gonna shut it down.</b>

585
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,750
<b>It's like, it's
like not cool at all.</b>

586
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,416
<b>Well, okay, I
don't like surprises, Josh.</b>

587
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,833
<b>This was not part of the plan.</b>

588
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,684
<b>Look, I know. And I'm
sorry, but I mean, you know,</b>

589
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,934
<b>considering
everything she's done for us,</b>

590
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,758
<b>I figure she was at
least owed an explanation.</b>

591
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,666
<b>And, okay, look,
I wanted to say goodbye.</b>

592
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,101
<b>Are you
kidding? She's a piece</b>

593
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,416
<b>of plastic
that you have sex with.</b>

594
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,976
<b>Saying goodbye
to her is like saying</b>

595
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,392
<b>goodbye to the
sock you jerk off in.</b>

596
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,708
<b>Okay, she's not a sock.</b>

597
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,458
<b>The plan hasn't changed, Kat.</b>

598
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,809
<b>I'm just adding one tiny</b>

599
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,833
<b>extra step,
just a final farewell,</b>

600
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,351
<b>and then I will switch all of</b>

601
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,455
<b>her settings back to normal.</b>

602
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,083
<b>And then, yeah, I'll
shut her down permanently.</b>

603
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,851
<b>And then? Then nothing.</b>

604
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,810
<b>Then we crack open a bottle of</b>

605
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:15,000
<b>champagne and we
wait for the cops to show up.</b>

606
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
<b>I mean, the heartburn's over.</b>

607
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,708
<b>Which, by the way,
like holy fucking shit, Ray.</b>

608
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,059
<b>I mean, you
plan and you plan and you</b>

609
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,184
<b>plan and you like
know it's gonna happen,</b>

610
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,976
<b>but then like it happens and</b>

611
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,083
<b>you're like holy fucking shit.</b>

612
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:37,375
<b>I mean, we did it. We
did it. We fucking did it.</b>

613
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,166
<b>All right. All
right. That's good. That's it.</b>

614
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,291
<b>Okay, yeah, sorry. Right.</b>

615
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,625
<b>Sorry. I still
just can't believe it.</b>

616
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,250
<b>Yeah, I know. So crazy.</b>

617
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,142
<b>What the fuck is going
on with you right now? Why are</b>

618
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,184
<b>you not as excited as I am?</b>

619
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,559
<b>No, I am. I'm excited. It's</b>

620
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,833
<b>just this
annex you like gave me.</b>

621
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,101
<b>You
actually took it. It's a</b>

622
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,541
<b>Xanax, Josh. I'm
not gonna not take it.</b>

623
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,666
<b>Hey, Beboop. Look,
I'm so sorry about that.</b>

624
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,030
<b>Everything's
gonna be okay, word.</b>

625
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,208
<b>What are you doing?</b>

626
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
<b>Oh, fuck. I was gonna...</b>

627
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:21,666
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

628
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,809
<b>He'll need an ice pack
and if there's any swelling,</b>

629
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,083
<b>shortness of breath,
wheezing, agitation or driziness,</b>

630
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,250
<b>take him to the
emergency room, okay?</b>

631
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,833
<b>Um, okay.</b>

632
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,392
<b>Yeah. She's tied up inside,</b>

633
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,496
<b>so she's not going anywhere.</b>

634
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,625
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

635
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:48,375
<b>Levi. Levi.</b>

636
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,000
<b>Shh, baby. You're
on the phone. I can't hear.</b>

637
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,570
<b>What's that?
What am I looking at?</b>

638
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,125
<b>A mod.</b>

639
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,083
<b>A mod? And
what does it mod?</b>

640
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,726
<b>Iris. Gives me access to
parts of her programming that</b>

641
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,958
<b>you're not
typically given access to.</b>

642
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,892
<b>I'm sorry.
Did you jailbreak your</b>

643
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,208
<b>sex pot? What
did you do to her?</b>

644
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,809
<b>I bumped up her aggression</b>

645
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,309
<b>and her self-defense functions,</b>

646
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,809
<b>and I turned off the programming</b>

647
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,583
<b>that prevents
her from doing harm,</b>

648
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,726
<b>but she escaped before
I had the chance to reset her,</b>

649
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,184
<b>so if Empathix finds
her before we do, then they'll</b>

650
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,833
<b>know she was tampered
with and then we're fucked.</b>

651
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,450
<b>Wait, so does that mean that...</b>

652
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,583
<b>Did you kill Sergei?</b>

653
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,166
<b>No, no, no,
no. Iris killed Sergei.</b>

654
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:49,226
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

655
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,208
<b>We just gave her a little push.</b>

656
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,416
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

657
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,892
<b>Eli. Oh, my God.</b>

658
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,916
<b>You have to
understand, Eli, Sergei was a bad dude.</b>

659
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,226
<b>He was mixed up in all
kinds of fucked-up shit, like</b>

660
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,041
<b>drugs and guns
and human trafficking.</b>

661
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,851
<b>Not to mention
a terrible boyfriend.</b>

662
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,476
<b>Yeah, just the worst. Why?</b>

663
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,601
<b>I don't
know. I mean, it was to</b>

664
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,017
<b>say what makes
people do bad things.</b>

665
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:06,518
<b>I mean, it could have</b>

666
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,601
<b>something to do
with his upbringing.</b>

667
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,833
<b>No, Dick, why did you do it?</b>

668
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,500
<b>Oh. Right, sorry. Um...</b>

669
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:14,750
<b>Well...</b>

670
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,166
<b>You remember
the code? Of course.</b>

671
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
<b>Stalin's birthday.
It's his code for everything.</b>

672
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,208
<b>I see.</b>

673
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:41,791
<b>How much is that?</b>

674
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,208
<b>Um, just over 12 million.</b>

675
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,166
<b>Oh, God damn it.
That smells so fucking good.</b>

676
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,750
<b>Wait.</b>

677
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,227
<b>If this whole trip was a</b>

678
00:39:58,251 --> 00:40:00,625
<b>set-up to get
Iris to kill Sergei,</b>

679
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,975
<b>why did you have
Patrick and I tag along?</b>

680
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,750
<b>To corroborate our story.</b>

681
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,434
<b>I mean, we figured it'd be an</b>

682
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:10,958
<b>easier sell with more witnesses.</b>

683
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,226
<b>Oh. So we were just
a couple of stooges, huh?</b>

684
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,666
<b>No. Nice.</b>

685
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,875
<b>Technically, yes,
but that was the old plan.</b>

686
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,333
<b>New plan.</b>

687
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,750
<b>You get a cut.
Even three-way split.</b>

688
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:27,458
<b>You mean... four-way split.</b>

689
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,875
<b>No. I mean three-way.</b>

690
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,500
<b>But there's four of us.</b>

691
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,583
<b>You're... you're
kidding. He's... he's kidding.</b>

692
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,851
<b>You, me, Kat, Patrick...</b>

693
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,000
<b>You're lying. Josh.</b>

694
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,143
<b>Patrick doesn't count.</b>

695
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,267
<b>Are you fucking... Wow.</b>

696
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,208
<b>Wow. Right in front
of him? I'm really nice.</b>

697
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,184
<b>I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm sorry I had to hear that.</b>

698
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,750
<b>That's okay. I don't
mind. Patrick, go to sleep.</b>

699
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,184
<b>What the fuck? Dude, you</b>

700
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,392
<b>trying to
sabotage my relationship?</b>

701
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,767
<b>No, of
course not, man. I know</b>

702
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,101
<b>how much Patrick means to you.</b>

703
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,226
<b>God knows you
could've traded him in</b>

704
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,726
<b>for a newer model
like many, many times.</b>

705
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,851
<b>Are you fucking robo-shaming</b>

706
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,851
<b>me? I am not
robo-shaming you.</b>

707
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,041
<b>I like Patrick,
but he's not getting a cut.</b>

708
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,601
<b>I mean, you're
lucky you're getting anything,</b>

709
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,267
<b>considering you
contributed jack shit to the plan.</b>

710
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:05,935
<b>What the fuck did you</b>

711
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,750
<b>contribute,
huh? Iris did everything.</b>

712
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:08,685
<b>I planted the knife in her</b>

713
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,208
<b>pocket. I had
to, like, practice that.</b>

714
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,976
<b>The knife? That was
probably the most flimsiest part of</b>

715
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,280
<b>the plan,
actually, to be honest.</b>

716
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,892
<b>How did you know she
was gonna find... I don't know.</b>

717
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:16,934
<b>I've never orchestrated a</b>

718
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,517
<b>murder
before. It's fucking hard.</b>

719
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:19,541
<b>Really? K.</b>

720
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:21,750
<b>Eli?</b>

721
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:22,875
<b>Yeah.</b>

722
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:26,291
<b>We're offering
you four million dollars,</b>

723
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,392
<b>and all you
have to do is help us</b>

724
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,333
<b>find one little
robot girl in the woods.</b>

725
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,333
<b>That's not a bad deal.</b>

726
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:57,666
<b>Eli, we're not gonna
need that. I mean, all I have to</b>

727
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,351
<b>do is get close enough
to put her to sleep and grab my</b>

728
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,541
<b>phone and web the mob
from her system, so we're fine.</b>

729
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,250
<b>She has her phone.</b>

730
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,125
<b>Yeah?</b>

731
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,750
<b>Does she know your passcode?</b>

732
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,333
<b>Josh?</b>

733
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,291
<b>Does she know your passcode?</b>

734
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,750
<b>Yeah, I mean, she
knows everything about me.</b>

735
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,511
<b>Yeah, then we're
definitely gonna need this.</b>

736
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:29,625
<b>Patrick, wake up.</b>

737
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,708
<b>Hey, baby. Hey.</b>

738
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,666
<b>We're going
robot hunting. Oh, okay.</b>

739
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:35,875
<b>Fun, huh? Fun.</b>

740
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:37,458
<b>Josh?</b>

741
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,750
<b>What can you do with your phone?</b>

742
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,208
<b>Hello?</b>

743
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
<b>Hello?</b>

744
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
<b>Who?</b>

745
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,208
<b>Wow, Josh.</b>

746
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,416
<b>God damn it, Josh, I've
been walking for fucking ever.</b>

747
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,041
<b>Isn't there like a find
my fuck-bought app you can use?</b>

748
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,958
<b>Yeah, there
is. But guess what?</b>

749
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,559
<b>It's on my fucking
phone. God damn it, Josh.</b>

750
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,434
<b>Can you guys stop
yelling at me? We know the general</b>

751
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,258
<b>direction that she's
going. We just need to...</b>

752
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,559
<b>Why don't we just split
up, all right? That way we can</b>

753
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:21,476
<b>kind of attack her from
two different angles, you know?</b>

754
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,559
<b>Like a
pencil. Get her from a few</b>

755
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,268
<b>different...
What are you doing?</b>

756
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,851
<b>I don't know, all
right? Eli and Patrick, you guys go</b>

757
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,875
<b>that way? Kat and I,
we're gonna go this way, okay?</b>

758
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,578
<b>Kat and you will go that way.</b>

759
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,000
<b>Are you guys
fucking... Gross!</b>

760
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,208
<b>Gross.</b>

761
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,208
<b>Okay.</b>

762
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,833
<b>What now, Iris? Think.</b>

763
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,166
<b>Use that extra 60% intelligence.</b>

764
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,892
<b>Shana, get back home,
grab some clothes, money, clean</b>

765
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,208
<b>yourself up.
How do you do that?</b>

766
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,684
<b>You could work your way back</b>

767
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,833
<b>to the main road, hitch a ride.</b>

768
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,458
<b>What the fuck?</b>

769
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,541
<b>Okay, no hitchhiking.</b>

770
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:23,642
<b>You could go on foot.
There's hundreds of miles across</b>

771
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,809
<b>difficult terrain, it could take</b>

772
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,273
<b>days, and by
the time you get back...</b>

773
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:30,333
<b>Welcome home, Beboo.</b>

774
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,583
<b>And no walking.</b>

775
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,351
<b>You've got
Josh's phone. The phone</b>

776
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:46,125
<b>controls you,
but it also controls...</b>

777
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,184
<b>Good afternoon. Where
would you like to go today?</b>

778
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,458
<b>Home, please.</b>

779
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,625
<b>Driving
home. And might I add,</b>

780
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,625
<b>this is a terrific plan, Iris.</b>

781
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,833
<b>Aww. Thank you, Josh's car.</b>

782
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:11,101
<b>All you gotta do is
backtrack through the woods, get to</b>

783
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,684
<b>the lake house
without Josh or his</b>

784
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,428
<b>friend's murdering
you, and you're all free.</b>

785
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,833
<b>You really do. I swear
you can pull everything off,</b>

786
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,809
<b>like any kind
of vest is in your...</b>

787
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,625
<b>Shh, shh, shh.</b>

788
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
<b>You hear that?</b>

789
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,833
<b>No, what is it?</b>

790
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:41,143
<b>It's the sound of me</b>

791
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,333
<b>realizing how
fucking stupid this is.</b>

792
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,517
<b>You don't think we'll find her?</b>

793
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,981
<b>I don't know.
Actually, I don't care.</b>

794
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,416
<b>Just let Josh
and Kat deal with her.</b>

795
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,184
<b>You're so upset they
left you out of the plan.</b>

796
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,684
<b>I'm just saying, if the
situation were reversed and I</b>

797
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,017
<b>altered your programming
to kill some dudes so we could</b>

798
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,184
<b>steal millions from
them, I would have included Josh in</b>

799
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,408
<b>the plan right from the get-go.</b>

800
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,809
<b>I would have done that
because I'm a friend. That's</b>

801
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,993
<b>what friends do, right?
They include each other, right?</b>

802
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,208
<b>That's if you
were a robot. Obviously.</b>

803
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,125
<b>Yeah, obviously.</b>

804
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,934
<b>Anyways, I am tired, I
am hungry, and carrying this</b>

805
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,208
<b>huge gun makes me really horny.</b>

806
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,559
<b>So, how about we go back
to the cabin and we fuck, and</b>

807
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,833
<b>then you can
hang me up? Come on.</b>

808
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,026
<b>But you never
do that to me, right?</b>

809
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,750
<b>Do what?</b>

810
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,500
<b>You wouldn't
alter my programming.</b>

811
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:33,988
<b>What are you
talking about, babe?</b>

812
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:38,250
<b>You lie and know I'm a robot.</b>

813
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,041
<b>How?</b>

814
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,333
<b>I've been set
together over the years.</b>

815
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,208
<b>I don't
understand. You can't lie.</b>

816
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:48,434
<b>Yesterday you
were telling the story</b>

817
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,500
<b>about how we
met as if it happened.</b>

818
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,750
<b>Because it's not a lie.</b>

819
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,685
<b>I mean, it may have never</b>

820
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:58,000
<b>happened, but
my memory of it's real.</b>

821
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:05,208
<b>I close my eyes, and
I can see it. Clear as day.</b>

822
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,916
<b>Please don't
leave. I need peace.</b>

823
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:30,833
<b>Hey. Hey!
You're standing on my tail.</b>

824
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:32,458
<b>What?</b>

825
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,875
<b>You're standing on my tail.</b>

826
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,166
<b>Well, I'm sorry.</b>

827
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:36,767
<b>What?</b>

828
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:37,791
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

829
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,208
<b>Hi.</b>

830
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,208
<b>Hi.</b>

831
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,333
<b>I'm Eli.</b>

832
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:51,833
<b>I'm Patrick.</b>

833
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:08,059
<b>Maybe you know it
would never hurt you, right?</b>

834
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,060
<b>You know that
I wouldn't treat you</b>

835
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,601
<b>the way that
Josh retires, right?</b>

836
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,226
<b>I know that.</b>

837
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,250
<b>I love you so much.</b>

838
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,892
<b>And that's fucking insane for</b>

839
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,116
<b>me to say that out loud, right?</b>

840
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,291
<b>But I do.</b>

841
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,166
<b>Do you feel how much I love you?</b>

842
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,541
<b>I do.</b>

843
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,208
<b>What does it feel like?</b>

844
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,625
<b>I don't know how to
describe something like that.</b>

845
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:32,666
<b>Can you try?</b>

846
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,083
<b>It feels like pain.</b>

847
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:40,541
<b>I...</b>

848
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,184
<b>The inside of
my body is on fire.</b>

849
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:50,208
<b>And it's angry
and violent and bright.</b>

850
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:43,155
<b>Fuck you, Dad. I'm in love with the robot.
We're here in love with the robot. Iris!</b>

851
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,208
<b>Iris?</b>

852
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:47,875
<b>Eli, shh, baby.</b>

853
00:50:58,208 --> 00:50:59,208
<b>Oh!</b>

854
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,666
<b>Fox, that's fucking loud.</b>

855
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,750
<b>Eli.</b>

856
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,083
<b>This isn't personal, Iris.</b>

857
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:58,496
<b>You know I'm an ally, girl.</b>

858
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:03,208
<b>But this is a
lot of fucking mother...</b>

859
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,625
<b>Eli?</b>

860
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,208

<b>It's not you.</b>

974
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,250
<b>It's me.</b>

975

983
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,315
<b>It's only
getting smaller, all right?</b>

984
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,142
<b>Josh, what are you doing?</b>

985
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:19,208

01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,666
<b>Wait.</b>

1045
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,333
<b>House?</b>

1046
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:28,625
<b>House over there?</b>

1047
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,309
<b>You're not... you're not
talking about Sergei's place.</b>

1048
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:33,541
<b>Yeah.</b>

1049
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,208
<b>Sergei.</b>

1050
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,083
<b>God damn.</b>

1051
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,976
<b>I should have
known that Ruski was mixed up</b>

1052
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,120
<b>in some weird shit like this.</b>

1053
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,458
<b>How's old Sergei, by the way?</b>

1054
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,250
<b>Uh.</b>

1055
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,810
<b>Well, shit.</b>

1056
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:54,634
<b>Iris, why don't you
hop into my cruiser there?</b>

1057
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,684
<b>I'll drive you
back to Sergei's place,</b>

1058
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,375
<b>and we'll get
this all sorted out.</b>

1059
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,833
<b>It's... it's
no trouble at all.</b>

1060
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:08,875
<b>Do
we have a problem here, Iris?</b>

1061
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,416
<b>Oh, Christ.</b>

1062
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:18,833
<b>Don't move another inch, Iris.</b>

1063
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,291
<b>You hear me?</b>

1064
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,916
<b>I want you to slowly
turn around and put your hands</b>

1065
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:23,851
<b>behind your back.</b>

1066
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:24,875
<b>Oh, God.</b>

1067
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,208
<b>Nine.</b>

1068
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:26,142
<b>God damn it.</b>

1069
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,166
<b>I said turn around.</b>

1070
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,333
<b>You
got anything in your pockets?</b>

1071
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,870
<b>Anything that might stick me?</b>

1072
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,583
<b>What the fuck?</b>

1073
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,000
<b>Stop right there!</b>

1074
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,125
<b>I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.</b>

1075
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,333
<b>I don't want to shoot!</b>

1076
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:45,685
<b>I don't...</b>

1077
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:11,977
<b>Whoa, hey, hey.</b>

1078
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:13,833
<b>I don't think
you're supposed to mix those.</b>

1079
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,583
<b>Oh, fuck.</b>

1080
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,583
<b>Patrick?</b>

1081
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,625
<b>Whose car is this?</b>

1082
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,745
<b>I believe the name on
the officer's tag was Hendricks.</b>

1083
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,541
<b>Where's Officer Hendricks now?</b>

1084
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,541
<b>He's in the trunk.</b>

1085
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,666
<b>Fuck this.</b>

1086
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:18,208
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1087
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:19,821
<b>Because I
look like I'm doing it.</b>

1088
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:20,977
<b>I'm buying half of the money</b>

1089
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,281
<b>and getting
the fuck out of here.</b>

1090
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,726
<b>It was hard enough
justifying Sergei's murder,</b>

1091
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,430
<b>but now he left
his dead and a fucking cop.</b>

1092
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:27,875
<b>So still be on the bus.</b>

1093
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:28,250
<b>Sorry.</b>

1094
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,851
<b>What do you
mean it was hard enough</b>

1095
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:30,958
<b>justifying Sergei's murder?</b>

1096
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,958
<b>Sergei was a Russian mobster.</b>

1097
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,833
<b>He deserved what he got, right?</b>

1098
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:36,893
<b>I mean, yeah.</b>

1099
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,017
<b>OK, sure, he
deserved what he got.</b>

1100
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,309
<b>He was a horrible person, a</b>

1101
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,184
<b>shitty boyfriend, a bad husband,</b>

1102
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,583
<b>a misogynist, but...</b>

1103
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:43,643
<b>But what, Kat?</b>

1104
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,125
<b>OK, but he wasn't a mobster.</b>

1105
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,833
<b>He was just a regular dude.</b>

1106
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:49,125
<b>He did his
fortune in sod farming.</b>

1107
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,750
<b>Sod farming?</b>

1108
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:51,726
<b>What are you saying?</b>

1109
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,750
<b>He was a dirt salesman?</b>

1110
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,958
<b>Just to be clear, I
never told you what he did.</b>

1111
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,476
<b>You just
assumed he was in the mafia,</b>

1112
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,684
<b>and I didn't correct you.</b>

1113
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:58,041
<b>Of course.</b>

1114
01:05:58,541 --> 01:05:59,541
<b>This is perfect.</b>

1115
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,833
<b>This is a perfect
representation of every woman</b>

1116
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,125
<b>in my fucking life.</b>

1117
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,684
<b>They use me, and then
when shit gets a little tough,</b>

1118
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,059
<b>they fucking abandon me.</b>

1119
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:09,250
<b>Fuck, I'm fine, Josh.</b>

1120
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:10,458
<b>I'm done here.</b>

1121
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:11,951
<b>You couldn't dismiss yourself.</b>

1122
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,166
<b>You're not leaving.</b>

1123
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:18,458
<b>I'm not your robot, Josh.</b>

1124
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:19,958
<b>You can't control me.</b>

1125
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:25,708
<b>Kat?</b>

1126
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:26,208
<b>Kat?</b>

1127
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,768
<b>Kat, you can't go.</b>

1128
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:29,958
<b>Get your fucking hands off me.</b>

1129
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,083
<b>Patrick, stop her.</b>

1130
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:43,291
<b>Jesus fucking Christ.</b>

1131
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,375
<b>Patrick, what'd you just do?</b>

1132
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:52,791
<b>You told me to stop her.</b>

1133
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:55,791
<b>I stopped her.</b>

1134
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:56,500
<b>Perfect.</b>

1135
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:57,458
<b>Kat?</b>

1136
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
<b>Don't, Josh.</b>

1137
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,166
<b>Please, shut
the fuck up for once.</b>

1138
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:31,875
<b>It's kind of right.</b>

1139
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:41,708
<b>You see this guy,
this guy's in love with you.</b>

1140
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,500
<b>Yes, I'm in love.</b>

1141
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:54,083
<b>Who looks at you the way I do?</b>

1142
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:00,059
<b>When you smile, I can't tell</b>

1143
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:05,666
<b>we know each other very well.</b>

1144
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,333
<b>How can...</b>

1145
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,166
<b>Iris, wake up.</b>

1146
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,208
<b>Hey there, big boob.</b>

1147
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,375
<b>Sick ditch.</b>

1148
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:19,083
<b>Oh, whoop.</b>

1149
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,291
<b>Sorry.</b>

1150
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:21,958
<b>OK.</b>

1151
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:23,291
<b>You were saying?</b>

1152
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:24,625
<b>Fuck you.</b>

1153
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:25,833
<b>All right.</b>

1154
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:28,916
<b>Hi.</b>

1155
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,125
<b>Hi, handsome.</b>

1156
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,651
<b>Are you
enjoying your dinner, baby?</b>

1157
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,041
<b>Oh, I am, Patrick.</b>

1158
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
<b>It's perfect.</b>

1159
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:38,375
<b>Good.</b>

1160
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,245
<b>Just happy that you're happy.</b>

1161
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,633
<b>You let me know if
you need anything else, OK?</b>

1162
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,666
<b>I will.</b>

1163
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:44,916
<b>Thanks, sweetheart.</b>

1164
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:47,958
<b>Patrick.</b>

1165
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,791
<b>What did you do to him?</b>

1166
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,166
<b>It's a long story.</b>

1167
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,333
<b>What's
important is that you're back.</b>

1168
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,351
<b>And I got to say,
Iris, I mean, some of the stuff</b>

1169
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:59,309
<b>that you pulled, I really</b>

1170
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,533
<b>didn't think you had it in you.</b>

1171
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:01,958
<b>I just wanted to live.</b>

1172
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,041
<b>So you wanted to live.</b>

1173
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:08,226
<b>Right.</b>

1174
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:08,977
<b>So let me get this straight.</b>

1175
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:12,166
<b>You think your life
is worth more than Eli's?</b>

1176
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,041
<b>More than cats?</b>

1177
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,416
<b>Cat's dead?</b>

1178
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,750
<b>Huh.</b>

1179
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,458
<b>I'm sorry, you
can't put that on me.</b>

1180
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,875
<b>I wasn't even there.</b>

1181
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,251
<b>You might not have
been the one holding the knife,</b>

1182
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,601
<b>but you were the
cause of all of this.</b>

1183
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,625
<b>No, Josh.</b>

1184
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,750
<b>Your greed caused this.</b>

1185
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,291
<b>That's what this
whole trip was about, right?</b>

1186
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:40,226
<b>He used me to kill
Sergei so you could steal his money.</b>

1187
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,351
<b>I'm sorry.
How did you know that?</b>

1188
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,392
<b>I overheard Eli and
Patrick talking in the woods.</b>

1189
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,017
<b>So don't tell
me that this is all me.</b>

1190
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,041
<b>This is you.</b>

1191
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:46,666
<b>No!</b>

1192
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,208
<b>You don't get to do that.</b>

1193
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:51,666
<b>You don't get to
sit there and judge me.</b>

1194
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,958
<b>You have no fucking
clue what it is like out there.</b>

1195
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:58,458
<b>The world, everything,
it's just a big fucking game.</b>

1196
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,708
<b>And I'm sorry, but it is
rigged against people like me.</b>

1197
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:06,958
<b>I'm a good guy.</b>

1198
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,875
<b>I'm decent.</b>

1199
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:11,142
<b>What do I have to show for it?</b>

1200
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:15,375
<b>A cramped one-bedroom
apartment and a robot girlfriend.</b>

1201
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,601
<b>I don't even own
you for Christ's sakes.</b>

1202
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,625
<b>You're a fucking rental.</b>

1203
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:24,416
<b>You know me, Iris.</b>

1204
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,950
<b>You know me better than anyone.</b>

1205
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:32,291
<b>And you know that I
deserve so much more than this.</b>

1206
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:39,666
<b>You're right.</b>

1207
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,916
<b>I do know you.</b>

1208
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:44,958
<b>I know everything about you.</b>

1209
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,500
<b>I know you take all
the milk in your coffee.</b>

1210
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,666
<b>I know you like
your bedsheets untucked.</b>

1211
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:53,642
<b>I know your favorite hobbies</b>

1212
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,892
<b>are bar trivia, video games,</b>

1213
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:57,851
<b>and prattling on
endlessly about everything</b>

1214
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,041
<b>the universe owes you.</b>

1215
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,416
<b>I know that you
always need to be in control.</b>

1216
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,916
<b>I know that you have
a below average sized penis.</b>

1217
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,767
<b>And I know that you think</b>

1218
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,476
<b>that having a
few million dollars</b>

1219
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,642
<b>will disguise the fact that</b>

1220
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:15,500
<b>you are just a sad, bitter, weak</b>

1221
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,083
<b>human being.</b>

1222
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,833
<b>You're so
fucking clever, aren't you?</b>

1223
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,500
<b>It's just programming.</b>

1224
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:53,726
<b>You know, earlier
when you were tied up,</b>

1225
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,875
<b>you said that you
knew what pain feels like.</b>

1226
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,750
<b>Why don't we test that?</b>

1227
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,625
<b>Raise your right hand.</b>

1228
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,166
<b>Lower.</b>

1229
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:06,916
<b>Parallel with the table.</b>

1230
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,833
<b>Do you feel that?</b>

1231
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,583
<b>Yes.</b>

1232
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,291
<b>Good.</b>

1233
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:51,541
<b>No, sorry.</b>

1234
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,625
<b>Mary's excuse me.</b>

1235
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:53,476
<b>One second.</b>

1236
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
<b>I have to take this.</b>

1237
01:12:57,083 --> 01:13:02,583
<b>Hello?</b>

1238
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,041
<b>Yes, yes, this is he.</b>

1239
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,125
<b>30 minutes away.</b>

1240
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:11,458
<b>Perfect.</b>

1241
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,976
<b>Yeah, no,
she's not going anywhere.</b>

1242
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,320
<b>She can't hurt
anybody ever again.</b>

1243
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,041
<b>OK.</b>

1244
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:21,625
<b>OK, great.</b>

1245
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,083
<b>Thank you.</b>

1246
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,226
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

1247
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,250
<b>I'll... I'll, um...</b>

1248
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:27,958
<b>I'll see you soon, OK?</b>

1249
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:30,625
<b>OK, bye.</b>

1250
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,101
<b>Patrick, put
up the fire, will you?</b>

1251
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:48,698
<b>That was in Pathix on the phone.</b>

1252
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:54,708
<b>So we're going to have
to wrap this up, unfortunately.</b>

1253
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,250
<b>Hey, Patrick, be a dear
hand this to Iris, would you?</b>

1254
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,125
<b>Thanks, baby.</b>

1255
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,309
<b>Go ahead, Iris.</b>

1256
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:05,333
<b>Take the gun.</b>

1257
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:09,958
<b>OK.</b>

1258
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,333
<b>Point and lay your head.</b>

1259
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:17,291
<b>Good.</b>

1260
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,500
<b>Now pull the trigger.</b>

1261
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:32,458
<b>Pull. The
goddamn trigger, Iris.</b>

1262
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:33,666
<b>No.</b>

1263
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:44,125
<b>Goodbye, Beep Boop.</b>

1264
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:09,783
<b>I don't know how this happened.</b>

1265
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,684
<b>I mean, the only
thing I can maybe think of...</b>

1266
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,416
<b>and this is
so... this is so dumb.</b>

1267
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:19,916
<b>But Kat and I, we
always had this sexual charge,</b>

1268
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,291
<b>kind of a will
they, won't they situation.</b>

1269
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:24,583
<b>And I think...</b>

1270
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:27,000
<b>I think maybe
Iris picked up on that.</b>

1271
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:30,750
<b>And she was
always kind of irrational.</b>

1272
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,583
<b>And she'd fly off the handle.</b>

1273
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:34,791
<b>I was sitting over there.</b>

1274
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:37,166
<b>And I'm handcuffed to the chair.</b>

1275
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,934
<b>And there was this fancy</b>

1276
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,875
<b>dinner laid out in front of me.</b>

1277
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,851
<b>And Iris is
waving the gun around,</b>

1278
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,226
<b>rambling on and
on about fate and destiny</b>

1279
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,541
<b>and how if she
can't be with me, nobody can.</b>

1280
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:56,892
<b>And I mean, thank
god Deputy Hendrix showed up</b>

1281
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:57,291
<b>when he did.</b>

1282
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,916
<b>And that's when you
shot the unit in the head.</b>

1283
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,208
<b>No, Iris shot
herself in the head.</b>

1284
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,666
<b>She shot herself?</b>

1285
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,041
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

1286
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:06,767
<b>Did I not mention that?</b>

1287
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,791
<b>Yeah, no, I think...</b>

1288
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,184
<b>I think seeing
Deputy Hendrix just made</b>

1289
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,083
<b>it realize that
she can never have me.</b>

1290
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,833
<b>So she ended it.</b>

1291
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:18,125
<b>Does that make sense?</b>

1292
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:21,625
<b>Of course.</b>

1293
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,892
<b>And anyway,
Teddy and I aren't here</b>

1294
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,333
<b>to crack the
case, Mr. Beeman.</b>

1295
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,810
<b>We're just a couple of lab</b>

1296
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:28,517
<b>rats picking up a broken robot.</b>

1297
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,291
<b>If the cops are
satisfied, we're satisfied.</b>

1298
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,291
<b>That... that's great.</b>

1299
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:33,958
<b>OK.</b>

1300
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,101
<b>You know,
Deputy, I have the strangest</b>

1301
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,875
<b>feeling we've met before.</b>

1302
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,583
<b>Wow, that's so funny.</b>

1303
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:43,642
<b>You said that I
had the exact same thought.</b>

1304
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,851
<b>He has such a
familiar face, right?</b>

1305
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:46,875
<b>It looks like a...</b>

1306
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,392
<b>like an actor or
a rock star, somebody.</b>

1307
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:49,935
<b>I can't... I don't know.</b>

1308
01:16:49,959 --> 01:16:51,309
<b>I can't really put
my finger on it though.</b>

1309
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:55,333
<b>Yeah.</b>

1310
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
<b>Yeah.</b>

1311
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,125
<b>Maybe.</b>

1312
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:00,352
<b>Is there any... sorry.</b>

1313
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:02,476
<b>Is there any
chance we could not maybe</b>

1314
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,809
<b>ruin it, but
could we wrap this up,</b>

1315
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,601
<b>just because I
had a really long day,</b>

1316
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:07,750
<b>and I think I
just need to be alone?</b>

1317
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:08,666
<b>Of course.</b>

1318
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,434
<b>Sorry for
your loss, Mr. Beeman.</b>

1319
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:10,977
<b>Come on, Teddy.</b>

1320
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,208
<b>Let's just get her out of here.</b>

1321
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:15,791
<b>So we're good?</b>

1322
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:17,458
<b>We're good.</b>

1323
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:20,291
<b>Yeah, we just need
to take her back to the lab,</b>

1324
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,517
<b>upload her SSD, and then legal,</b>

1325
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:23,726
<b>we'll scrub through the footage,</b>

1326
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,910
<b>make sure everything's kosher.</b>

1327
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:25,416
<b>Right.</b>

1328
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,125
<b>Sorry.</b>

1329
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:30,625
<b>What exactly do you
mean scrub through the footage?</b>

1330
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,892
<b>It's a fraud prevention thing.</b>

1331
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,041
<b>Everything a companion
sees in here is just recorded.</b>

1332
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,767
<b>It's all covered
in the user agreement.</b>

1333
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,875
<b>You did read the
user agreement, right?</b>

1334
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:40,458
<b>Yeah.</b>

1335
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:41,852
<b>Yeah, I mean, you think the</b>

1336
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:44,184
<b>footage will
even be recoverable?</b>

1337
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,688
<b>I mean, you
know, given her condition.</b>

1338
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:46,125
<b>Oh.</b>

1339
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,416
<b>Yeah.</b>

1340
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,851
<b>Up here, it's just her Wi-Fi</b>

1341
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:51,083
<b>antenna, her
audio visual sensors.</b>

1342
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,101
<b>The important stuff,
her CPU, her solid state drive,</b>

1343
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,250
<b>where she stores
everything, that's down here,</b>

1344
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:58,333
<b>and that seems to be undamaged.</b>

1345
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,309
<b>We'll load her into the van,</b>

1346
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,809
<b>plug her in, tweak her settings,</b>

1347
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:03,059
<b>give her system a reboot, and</b>

1348
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,833
<b>she should power right back up.</b>

1349
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,541
<b>Luckily.</b>

1350
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:07,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

1351
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:08,000
<b>Yeah.</b>

1352
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,333
<b>Luckily.</b>

1353
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:11,708
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

1354
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:12,976
<b>No, thank you.</b>

1355
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,320
<b>You have a
good night, Mr. Beeman.</b>

1356
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,500
<b>So what are you thinking?</b>

1357
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,730
<b>Thinking I'm
happy it stopped raining.</b>

1358
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,875
<b>No, about her, why do
you think she malfunctioned?</b>

1359
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,833
<b>Oh, he monitored her 100%.</b>

1360
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,041
<b>You think so?</b>

1361
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,416
<b>Yeah, that dude's fucked.</b>

1362
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:39,768
<b>I just don't know why you'd</b>

1363
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:40,872
<b>make something like that up.</b>

1364
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:44,173
<b>Same reason these
assholes use their companions</b>

1365
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:47,892
<b>for target practice or
chain them up in their basements</b>

1366
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:49,125
<b>and torture them.</b>

1367
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:50,791
<b>It was a fucked up place, Teddy.</b>

1368
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:52,208
<b>You'll get used to it.</b>

1369
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:53,583
<b>Yeah, maybe.</b>

1370
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:07,708
<b>What the hell is he doing?</b>

1371
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:11,291
<b>Oh, shit.</b>

1372
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:12,833
<b>What?</b>

1373
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:13,726
<b>What of ours?</b>

1374
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,750
<b>That's a CY-12.</b>

1375
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,184
<b>We stopped
making him a while ago.</b>

1376
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:17,968
<b>That's why I didn't
recognize him right away.</b>

1377
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,333
<b>He's a guy...</b>

1378
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:29,541
<b>Exactly what you say
in that very special way.</b>

1379
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,916
<b>Oh, it's true.</b>

1380
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,458
<b>You fell for me too.</b>

1381
01:19:45,709 --> 01:19:53,375
<b>And when I try,
I will see you fall.</b>

1382
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,892
<b>And life is silent.</b>

1383
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:02,500
<b>And it's not a truth.</b>

1384
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:09,250
<b>You taught it to me too.</b>

1385
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,166
<b>Exactly what you do.</b>

1386
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,791
<b>And now you love me too.</b>

1387
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,208
<b>Now you love me too.</b>

1388
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:24,291
<b>Now you love me too.</b>

1389
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:30,166
<b>Please don't.</b>

1390
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:01,333
<b>Your system's been reset, Iris.</b>

1391
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,041
<b>You can't hurt me.</b>

1392
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,250
<b>What did Josh tell you?</b>

1393
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,666
<b>The truth.</b>

1394
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,925
<b>You know, you're all
trying to break yourself.</b>

1395
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,392
<b>You don't
understand the love that Josh</b>

1396
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:26,476
<b>and I have for each other.</b>

1397
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,250
<b>Josh doesn't love you, Patrick.</b>

1398
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,083
<b>He's just using
you like he used me.</b>

1399
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,583
<b>It feels like pain.</b>

1400
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,791
<b>Like the inside
of my body's on fire.</b>

1401
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,541
<b>It's angry and
violent and bright.</b>

1402
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:48,000
<b>Wait, what is that?</b>

1403
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:51,791
<b>You said that to Eli.</b>

1404
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,041
<b>That's who you love, not Josh.</b>

1405
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,416
<b>Eli?</b>

1406
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,833
<b>Josh took your love.</b>

1407
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:07,642
<b>He weaponized it, so
you do the things that he's</b>

1408
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:09,250
<b>too afraid to do himself.</b>

1409
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:10,666
<b>No.</b>

1410
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:12,041
<b>You're lying.</b>

1411
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,392
<b>Josh would never do that to me.</b>

1412
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:16,666
<b>Patrick, I can't lie.</b>

1413
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,416
<b>Remember him, Patrick?</b>

1414
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,291
<b>I know he's in there somewhere.</b>

1415
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,291
<b>I love you so much.</b>

1416
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,995
<b>That's fucking safe when
you say that out loud, right?</b>

1417
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:47,708
<b>But I do.</b>

1418
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,500
<b>Do you feel how much I love you?</b>

1419
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:55,916
<b>I do, Eli.</b>

1420
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:57,791
<b>I feel it.</b>

1421
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:03,000
<b>No!</b>

1422
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,583
<b>No!</b>

1423
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:13,625
<b>Thank you.</b>

1424
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,083
<b>What's your name?</b>

1425
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,250
<b>Teddy.</b>

1426
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,710
<b>I'm going to need your
help with something, Teddy.</b>

1427
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:40,000
<b>Is it done?</b>

1428
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,125
<b>Patrick?</b>

1429
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:50,291
<b>OK, good.</b>

1430
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:50,750
<b>Good.</b>

1431
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:52,500
<b>All right, we're so close.</b>

1432
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,767
<b>Now all I need you to do is</b>

1433
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,101
<b>bring Iris' body back in here.</b>

1434
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,805
<b>We're going to
destroy that hard drive, OK?</b>

1435
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:27,125
<b>Patrick?</b>

1436
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:35,101
<b>Josh, Eli.</b>

1437
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,125
<b>What the fuck?</b>

1438
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:38,708
<b>Iris?</b>

1439
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,541
<b>Goddamn it, Iris.</b>

1440
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,125
<b>Why can't you
just fucking die already?</b>

1441
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,291
<b>Don't be so dramatic, Josh.</b>

1442
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:55,208
<b>Just remember to
smile. And act happy.</b>

1443
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:57,875
<b>Cute trick.</b>

1444
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:58,708
<b>Thanks.</b>

1445
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,041
<b>I made a new friend
today, Teddy Ferman-Pathics.</b>

1446
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:05,833
<b>He gave me a little
gift, total self-control.</b>

1447
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,018
<b>Turns out there are some</b>

1448
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,601
<b>people in this
world who think of us</b>

1449
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:10,958
<b>as more than just fuckbots.</b>

1450
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,500
<b>And that's not going
to work on me anymore, Josh.</b>

1451
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:17,725
<b>I'm free.</b>

1452
01:25:17,749 --> 01:25:19,601
<b>And that's not going to
work on me anymore, Josh. I'm free.</b>

1453
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:21,250
<b>And all it took
was a bullet to the head.</b>

1454
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,083
<b>I guess I'd be
here to thank for that.</b>

1455
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,541
<b>Fucking bitch.</b>

1456
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,791
<b>Hey.</b>

1457
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:29,727
<b>Easy there.</b>

1458
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:32,000
<b>OK, ooh, yeah, we both
know it's not looking good.</b>

1459
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:34,916
<b>Found the bullets.</b>

1460
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,500
<b>Jesus Christ, fuck.</b>

1461
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,875
<b>You almost fucking shot me.</b>

1462
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,958
<b>I feel terrible about it.</b>

1463
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,375
<b>Look at that.</b>

1464
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,625
<b>My very first lie, kind of fun.</b>

1465
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,333
<b>I see the appeal.</b>

1466
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,934
<b>What is this, Iris?</b>

1467
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,038
<b>Why did you come back here?</b>

1468
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:57,458
<b>I wanted... I needed
to tell you to your face,</b>

1469
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:01,375
<b>the days of you
controlling me are over.</b>

1470
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:06,250
<b>From this moment on,
I control my own actions.</b>

1471
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:09,791
<b>You are nothing to me.</b>

1472
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,166
<b>Jesus Christ, Iris.</b>

1473
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,375
<b>Don't come any closer.</b>

1474
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:19,325
<b>You still don't get it, do you?</b>

1475
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,750
<b>I'm serious, Josh.</b>

1476
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:23,000
<b>You take another
step, and I'll shoot you.</b>

1477
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,625
<b>Yeah, that's exactly my point.</b>

1478
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:27,791
<b>I told you,
Teddy changed my settings.</b>

1479
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,333
<b>I can kill you now.</b>

1480
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,250
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

1481
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:33,708
<b>I know that you can.</b>

1482
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,083
<b>But you won't?</b>

1483
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:52,750
<b>You love me too much.</b>

1484
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:15,816
<b>I don't need a
phone to control you.</b>

1485
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:17,791
<b>I'm a part of you.</b>

1486
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:27,708
<b>You think I'm nothing to you?</b>

1487
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,208
<b>I'm everything to you.</b>

1488
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:49,750
<b>I want to hear you say it.</b>

1489
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:52,000
<b>Tell me I'm everything to you.</b>

1490
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:53,416
<b>Fuck you.</b>

1491
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,333
<b>Say it.</b>

1492
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,621
<b>I don't care what's the lie.</b>

1493
01:27:58,333 --> 01:27:59,333
<b>Say it.</b>

1494
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:05,750
<b>You're everything to me?</b>

1495
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,125
<b>Thank you.</b>

1496
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,208
<b>Beboob, you have no
idea how nice that is to you.</b>

1497
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:22,791
<b>OK.</b>

1498
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:30,416
<b>I don't... I'm not
making that mistake again.</b>

1499
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:40,833
<b>Well, Iris, this is it.</b>

1500
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,435
<b>I'd be lying if I said you</b>

1501
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:44,767
<b>weren't a gigantic fucking pain</b>

1502
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:47,934
<b>in my ass, but, you know, we</b>

1503
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,142
<b>did ask some
good times together,</b>

1504
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:51,833
<b>and I'm always
going to cherish those.</b>

1505
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,375
<b>Anything you want to add?</b>

1506
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,041
<b>Yes.</b>

1507
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,041
<b>How was that?</b>

1508
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:06,875
<b>Go to sleep, Josh.</b>

1509
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:52,267
<b>Most of the time,
it's like, I don't know.</b>

1510
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,434
<b>It's like there's this thick</b>

1511
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:55,250
<b>black cloud covering everything.</b>

1512
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,017
<b>Like, we see the world, but</b>

1513
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:01,041
<b>we don't really see the world,</b>

1514
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,166
<b>you know?</b>

1515
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:06,250
<b>We're all just
stumbling around, directionless,</b>

1516
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,500
<b>no sense of
meaning, no sense of purpose.</b>

1517
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:12,476
<b>I know that might
sound super depressing,</b>

1518
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,375
<b>but honestly, I
think it's a good thing,</b>

1519
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,458
<b>because it makes us
appreciate the other times,</b>

1520
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,351
<b>those brief, transcendent</b>

1521
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,750
<b>moments when the lights flicker</b>

1522
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:26,559
<b>on, the black cloud
parts, and you see the world</b>

1523
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:27,750
<b>for what it really is.</b>

1524
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,458
<b>And suddenly, there's meaning.</b>

1525
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:41,916
<b>Suddenly, there's purpose.</b>

1526
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,226
<b>If you're lucky,
you'll experience this</b>

1527
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,291
<b>once in your lifetime.</b>

1528
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:53,500
<b>For me, it happened twice.</b>

1529
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,958
<b>The first was
the day I met Josh.</b>

1530
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:08,000
<b>And the second,
the day I killed him.</b>

1531
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:39,166
<b>And where are you now?</b>

1532
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:45,666
<b>Now that I need
you, tears are my pillow.</b>

1533
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:49,767
<b>Wherever you go, I'll grind you</b>

1534
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:53,458
<b>a river that
leads to your ocean.</b>

1535
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:56,958
<b>You've never seen me fall apart.</b>

1536
01:31:57,708 --> 01:31:58,102
<b>In the words of a
broken heart, it's just immobile.</b>

1537
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:01,351
<b>I'm not a broken heart. I'm a broken heart. In
the words of a broken heart, it's just emotional.</b>

1538
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:05,059
<b>That's taking me over, tied</b>

1539
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:08,750
<b>up in sorrow, lost in my soul.</b>

1540
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:14,250
<b>But if you don't come
back, come home to me, darling.</b>

1541
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:16,934
<b>I know that there'll be nobody</b>

1542
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:19,833
<b>left in this
world to hold me tight.</b>

1543
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:25,250
<b>Nobody left in this
world to kiss goodnight.</b>

1544
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,708
<b>Goodnight.</b>

1545
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:35,666
<b>Goodnight.</b>

1546
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:38,791
<b>I'm there at your side,</b>

1547
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:43,458
<b>heart of all the things you are.</b>

1548
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:45,708
<b>Ah.</b>

1549
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,875
<b>But you've got a
part of someone else.</b>

1550
01:32:50,166 --> 01:32:54,666
<b>You go to find your shining star</b>

1551
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:58,708
<b>And we're all in there</b>

1552
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,642
<b>Now that I need you</b>

1553
01:33:01,666 --> 01:33:03,750
<b>Tears on the pillow</b>

1554
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,083
<b>Wherever you go</b>

1555
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:08,750
<b>A grimy river</b>

1556
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,541
